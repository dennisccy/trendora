Your task is a FOCUSED UI EVOLUTION AUDIT ONLY for phase: $PHASE

Phase spec: $SPEC
Plan: $PLAN_FILE
Existing QA report (if any): $QA_REPORT
UI EVOLUTION POLICY is defined in: .claude/workflow.md

## Your job

Evaluate whether the UI meaningfully evolved for this phase by answering:

1. Did the UI evolve to reflect the phase's new capability?
2. Can the user now see, understand, and control the new capability from the UI?
3. Is the UI still relying on old generic pages for new functionality?
4. Is the implementation technically complete but product-wise underexposed?

Read the phase spec to understand what capability was added. Read the relevant frontend
files to assess what UI surfaces exist.

If the frontend is running (check $FRONTEND_URL), use Chrome MCP to verify
the key user-facing flows. If not running, assess from code only.

## Output

Assign one of these verdicts:
- **UI-PASS**: UI meaningfully reflects the new capability
- **UI-PASS-WITH-GAPS**: UI works but has notable gaps (list each)
- **UI-FAIL**: Backend capability is not adequately reflected in the UI

Write the audit report to: $UI_AUDIT_REPORT

Use this format:
\`\`\`
## UI Evolution Audit — ${PHASE}

**Verdict:** UI-PASS | UI-PASS-WITH-GAPS | UI-FAIL
