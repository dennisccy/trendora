Your job:
1. Read the agent instructions and skills above
2. For each surface in the UI surface map, create test cases (smoke, happy-path, validation, error, regression, UX)
3. Each test case must have exact steps with specific URLs, button text, field names, and expected outcomes
4. Write the 5-minute operator verification guide (max 10 steps)

Write these two reports:
  - $UI_TEST_PLAN  (use template: templates/ui-test-plan.md)
  - $WHAT_TO_CLICK  (use template: templates/what-to-click.md)

Every step must be independently executable. No vague steps like 'test the form' or 'verify it works'.

# (`update_status ... ui_test_designed`). The next resume would then skip the

# without stubs, the working tree is unchanged so resume re-runs the step from
# scratch and run-phase.sh's signal-aware retry guard aborts the run cleanly.
