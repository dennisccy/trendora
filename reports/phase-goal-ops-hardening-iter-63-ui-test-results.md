## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Backfill honors the requested range and explains zero-work (live job card, not persisted history) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-03 | No per-run range cap (a >370-day span is accepted AND executes to completion in chunks) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-03-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Non-blocking boot with visible status — regression-hardening golden (J-04's product behavior is already proven/evidenced; this asserts the readiness badge's REAL data-state attribute and a persisted data_provider_runs-backed field, never a bare page-title/heading match) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-04-verify.png |
| UT-J-05 | Aggregates are precomputed at ingest, never on the fly — a live in-app backfill of ONE unsnapshotted historical trading day (2010-11-18 must have 0 snapshot rows before this runs; re-verify and rotate if a prior lane consumed it), waited out for its real duration, then proven from the run's OWN persisted record and its OWN /scanner-runs row | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-05-verify.png |
| UT-J-06 | Pages load only what they need | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-06-verify.png |
| UT-J-08 | Backtest evidence serves from storage only — never a cold recompute on request (payload-gated) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-08-verify.png |
| UT-J-09 | Disclose in-flight background-compute activity (badge + /data panel) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/J-09-verify.png |
| UT-J-07 | Heavy aggregates never take the service down (target) | regression | P1 | Readiness badge present with `data-state="ready"`; background-compute-panel renders a real non-fabricated state; last-run-status renders a genuine persisted status; aggregates-refreshed lists the finalize tail's refreshed categories; no freeze/spinner/5xx/blank error | All four elements rendered live, real values: readiness-badge `data-state="ready"` (text "Ready"); background-compute-panel showed a REAL in-flight warm (as-of 2026-07-31, elapsed 52.2s, horizons 0/5, dataset r2960-f6568295) that this pass happened to catch already running, not one triggered by the check; last-run-status="ok"; aggregates-refreshed="Refreshed: latest snapshot, coverage, membership timeline, market phase, forward aggregates, research hot keys, availability heatmap, factor lab all, drawdown expectations". No freeze, spinner-forever, or error observed. | PASS | `reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-63-evidence/UT-J-07-result.png` |
