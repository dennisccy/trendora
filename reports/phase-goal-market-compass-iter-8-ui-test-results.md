## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Sector attribution is honest and near-complete on new runs | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-8-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Every next-session candidate explains why, why-not, and what would change it | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-8-evidence/J-04-verify.png |

## Missing Target Journeys

_Target journeys named in the iteration spec's `Target journeys:` line — the journeys THIS iteration exists to verify — that were NOT verified this iteration, either no lane produced a row for them at all, or the only row they have reads SKIP (not executed). Never a clean PASS/SKIPPED headline while any of these are present (ops-hardening iter-41 audit finding B2 / iter-42 fix: promoting a journey to an iteration's own target silently removed its verification — iter-41 itself shipped a clean PASS 6/6 headline while its two target journeys had zero rows anywhere)._

- `UT-J-10` — no test case executed for J-10 by any lane
