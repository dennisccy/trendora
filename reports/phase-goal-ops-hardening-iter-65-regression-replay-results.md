## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Backfill honors the requested range and explains zero-work (live job card, not persisted history) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-03 | No per-run range cap (a >370-day span is accepted AND executes to completion in chunks) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-03-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Non-blocking boot with visible status — regression-hardening golden (J-04's product behavior is already proven/evidenced; this asserts the readiness badge's REAL data-state attribute and a persisted data_provider_runs-backed field, never a bare page-title/heading match) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-04-verify.png |
| UT-J-05 | Aggregates are precomputed at ingest, never on the fly — a live in-app backfill of ONE unsnapshotted historical trading day (2005-06-29, resolved at replay time and guaranteed to have 0 snapshot rows — see this file's _notes), waited out for its real duration, then proven from the run's OWN persisted record and its OWN /scanner-runs row | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-05-verify.png |
| UT-J-06 | Pages load only what they need | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-06-verify.png |
| UT-J-08 | Backtest evidence serves from storage only — never a cold recompute on request (payload-gated) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-08-verify.png |
| UT-J-09 | Disclose in-flight background-compute activity (badge + /data panel) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-09-verify.png |
| UT-J-07 | Heavy aggregates never take the service down — regression-hardening golden reading GET /api/health-backed attributes and persisted data_provider_runs fields, never a bare page-title/heading match | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-65-evidence/J-07-verify.png |
