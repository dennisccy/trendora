# Performance Budgets

Committed measurements for the data path on the 30-year / 587-symbol basis (`daily_prices` 3,270,066
rows, 1.3 GB DB). Created in **iter-19** to record fast-platform **item A** (the `/api/data` bar-prefill
OOM fix) per goal.md J-15/J-16's sequencing — this file does **not** yet claim the full J-15/J-16 budget
contracts (every endpoint, every item B–K optimization); those land with their own iterations and append
to this table. Every number below is a real measurement on this host, not an estimate.

## How to reproduce

```bash
bash scripts/start-backend.sh            # cold boot, real committed seed/DB, ulimit -v 6144 MB applied
curl -s http://localhost:<port>/api/data # cold hit (first call after boot — membership-timeline cache miss)
```

Peak RSS sampled via `/proc/<pid>/status` `VmRSS`/`VmHWM` at 0.2–0.25 s intervals for the duration of the
request(s), against the real 30-year DB (no synthetic/scaled-down fixture).

## Item A — bound the bar-prefill OOM (iter-19)

**Problem (measured, iter-18 operator incident):** `prices.py`'s `_BarCache.prefill()` materialized the
whole `daily_prices` table as hydrated `DailyPrice` ORM instances in one `.all()` call (~6.8 GB peak
reported), against the 6144 MB `server.memory_cap_mb` `ulimit -v` cap — the backend OOM'd/hung on its
first `/api/data` visit under the canonical browser-QA lane. A second, distinct cost compounded it: the
same whole-table scan re-ran a SECOND time within one request (`_membership_timeline`'s nested
`prefilled_bar_cache` call on top of `_compute_coverage_uncached`'s own context), because `prefill()`
re-queried unconditionally on every call — invisible at the old ~122-symbol/5-year basis, a doubled
contribution to the OOM at 583 symbols/30 years.

**Fix:** `_BarCache.prefill()` now streams a column-projected query (`symbol, date, open, high, low,
close, volume` — not a whole `DailyPrice` ORM row) via `.yield_per(research.read_batch_size)`, building a
lightweight `Bar` NamedTuple per row (module `app/engine/prices.py`); the lazy per-symbol fallback inside
`bars_asof()` adopts the same lightweight record type (already per-symbol-bounded — no bounding change).
`prefill()` also now skips its expensive scan entirely once already run on that cache instance (a
`self._prefilled` guard), so the nested-call double-scan is eliminated. `ORDER BY symbol, date` and served
values are unchanged — `tests/test_bar_cache.py`'s byte-identical snapshot tests are the correctness gate.

**Measured (2026-07-07, this host, cold boot, real 30-year DB, `memory_cap_mb: 6144`):**

| Scenario | HTTP result | Wall time | Peak RSS (process) | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (post-boot, before any `/api/data` hit) | — | — | ~179 MB | — |
| **Single cold `/api/data`** | 200 (all) | 10.5 s | **~1,087 MB** (`VmHWM`) | ≤ 60 s, no OOM under 6144 MB |
| **6 concurrent cold `/api/data`** (the exact iter-18 incident shape) | 200 ×6 | 18.5 s (all 6) | **~1,101 MB** | ≤ 60 s, no OOM under 6144 MB |
| Settled RSS after the single cold request | — | — | ~243 MB | — |

**Before → after (item A):**

| | Before (reported, iter-18 incident) | After (measured, iter-19) |
|---|---|---|
| Retained/peak footprint, 1 cold request | ~6.8 GB (whole-table ORM `.all()`) | **~1.09 GB** |
| 6 concurrent cold requests | OOM / hung (exceeded the 6144 MB cap) | **~1.10 GB peak — NOT ~6×** (single-flight + streamed prefill hold memory to ~one copy regardless of concurrency) |
| Cold `/api/data` completion | did not complete (OOM) | **10.5 s (1 request) / 18.5 s (6 concurrent)** — both ≤ 60 s budget |

**Reading the numbers:** the ~1.09 GB peak is the transient cost of the ONE-TIME streamed scan building
583 `Bar` lists (3.27M lightweight records); it is not the *retained* steady-state footprint, which settles
back to ~243 MB once the request's `with prefilled_bar_cache(...):` block exits and the cache is garbage
collected. Either figure clears the 6144 MB cap with wide headroom — the prior ~6.8 GB estimate for the
unfixed ORM load left none. The 6-concurrent-request peak (~1.10 GB) barely exceeds the 1-request peak
(~1.09 GB), confirming the pre-existing J-100 single-flight (`compute_coverage`'s per-key lock + in-flight
event) already serializes concurrent cold callers correctly — iter-19's fix was the nested-call double-scan
inside a single compute, not the cross-request single-flight itself (see the dev handoff for the full
diagnosis).

**Config comment fix:** `config.yaml`'s `server.memory_cap_mb` comment referenced "the one-copy ~1.3M-row
bar prefill" (a stale figure from the pre-30y basis); it now cites the real ~3.27M-row figure and the
streamed-load footprint.

## Budgets not yet re-measured this iteration

Items B–K of goal.md's fast-platform section (mechanical backend pass, payload/interaction pass,
compute/storage pass) and the full J-15/J-16 endpoint-by-endpoint budget table (`/stocks`,
`/stocks/{ticker}`, `/api/data` warm path, `/api/health`, page time-to-interactive) are **out of scope for
iter-19** (goal.md sequencing: "iter-19 lands item A only"). They are deferred to the iterations goal.md
already schedules for that work, which will append their own measured rows here.
