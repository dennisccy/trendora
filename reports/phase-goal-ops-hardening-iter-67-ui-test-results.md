## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Backfill honors the requested range and explains zero-work (live job card, not persisted history) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-03 | No per-run range cap (a >370-day span is accepted AND executes to completion in chunks) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-03-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Non-blocking boot with visible status — regression-hardening golden (J-04's product behavior is already proven/evidenced; this asserts the readiness badge's REAL data-state attribute and a persisted data_provider_runs-backed field, never a bare page-title/heading match) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-04-verify.png |
| UT-J-05 | Aggregates are precomputed at ingest, never on the fly — a live in-app backfill of ONE unsnapshotted historical trading day (2005-07-05, resolved at replay time and guaranteed to have 0 snapshot rows — see this file's _notes), waited out for its real duration, then proven from the run's OWN persisted record and its OWN /scanner-runs row | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-05-verify.png |
| UT-J-06 | Pages load only what they need | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-06-verify.png |
| UT-J-08 | Backtest evidence serves from storage only — never a cold recompute on request (payload-gated) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-08-verify.png |
| UT-J-09 | Disclose in-flight background-compute activity (badge + /data panel) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/J-09-verify.png |
| UT-J-07 | Heavy aggregates never take the service down | regression/resilience | P1 | Backend stays responsive (`GET /api/health` → HTTP 200, no frozen window) throughout a live forward-aggregate warm; `/backtest` keeps serving from storage; UI readiness/background-compute surfaces stay honest | A real, ambient `factor_lab_all_warm`-family background-compute job was caught in flight and observed continuously for ~6 minutes: 90/90 `GET /api/health` polls at 1 Hz returned HTTP 200 (0 non-answers), max single-poll latency 1.685s (under the relaxed 2.0s bounded-compute ceiling); `/`, `/backtest`, and `/data` all rendered fully with no error/blank/5xx; `/data`'s live background-compute-panel text matched this agent's own concurrent `GET /api/health` polls exactly (as-of 2026-07-31, horizons progressing 1→2/5, dataset r2968-f6577530) | PASS | `reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-67-evidence/UT-J-07-result.png`, `j07-health-poll-1.csv`, `j07-health-poll-2.csv` |
