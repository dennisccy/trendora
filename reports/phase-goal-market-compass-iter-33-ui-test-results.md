## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Sector attribution is honest and near-complete on new runs | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-02 | "What changed" reports meaningful session-over-session deltas with honest empties | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-02-verify.png |
| UT-J-03 | The plain-English summary is deterministic, cited, and never invents a cause | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-03-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Every next-session candidate explains why, why-not, and what would change it | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-04-verify.png |
| UT-J-05 | Each close freezes one provenance-stamped next-session manifest, exported byte-consistently | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-05-verify.png |
| UT-J-06 | A frozen manifest never changes — later data, rebuilds, and regeneration are safe | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-06-verify.png |
| UT-J-07 | The Today page answers the ten-second read from served values only | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-07-verify.png |
| UT-J-08 | The market surface relocates intact and history never lies | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-08-verify.png |
| UT-J-10 | Bounded recovery of the two trading days the iter-5 drill deleted | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-10-verify.png |
| UT-J-11 | Incident-bounded clean regeneration of derived state (disposable-clone serving verification) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-market-compass-iter-33-evidence/J-11-verify.png |
| UT-J-09 | The backend fits the host — standing memory halves with zero behavior change | smoke | P1 | N/A — journey's own Acceptance waives the Walkthrough/UI check (backend-only; no displayed value may move) | No UI surface exists for this journey; verification is the dated VmPeak measurement, concurrent-load check, and byte-identity spot-check recorded in `docs/handoffs/goal-market-compass-iter-33-dev.md` and `reports/perf-budgets.md` Addendum 44, not a browser check | SKIP | none |

## Missing Target Journeys

_Target journeys named in the iteration spec's `Target journeys:` line — the journeys THIS iteration exists to verify — that were NOT verified this iteration, either no lane produced a row for them at all, or the only row they have reads SKIP (not executed). Never a clean PASS/SKIPPED headline while any of these are present (ops-hardening iter-41 audit finding B2 / iter-42 fix: promoting a journey to an iteration's own target silently removed its verification — iter-41 itself shipped a clean PASS 6/6 headline while its two target journeys had zero rows anywhere)._

- `UT-J-09` — only a SKIP row for J-09: named but never executed

## Skipped Tests

### UT-J-09 — The backend fits the host — standing memory halves with zero behavior change

**Verdict:** SKIPPED
**Reason:** No UI surface exists for this journey; verification is the dated VmPeak measurement, concurrent-load check, and byte-identity spot-check recorded in `docs/handoffs/goal-market-compass-iter-33-dev.md` and `reports/perf-budgets.md` Addendum 44, not a browser check
