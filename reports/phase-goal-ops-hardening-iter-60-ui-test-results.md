## Results Table

| Test ID | Name | Type | Priority | Expected | Actual | Verdict | Evidence |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| UT-J-01 | Backfill honors the requested range and explains zero-work (live job card, not persisted history) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-01-verify.png |
| UT-J-03 | No per-run range cap (a >370-day span is accepted AND executes to completion in chunks) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-03-verify.png |
| UT-J-04 | Non-blocking boot with visible status — regression-hardening golden (J-04's product behavior is already proven/evidenced; this asserts the readiness badge's REAL data-state attribute and a persisted data_provider_runs-backed field, never a bare page-title/heading match) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-04-verify.png |
| UT-J-06 | Pages load only what they need | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-06-verify.png |
| UT-J-08 | Backtest evidence serves from storage only — never a cold recompute on request (payload-gated) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-08-verify.png |
| UT-J-09 | Disclose in-flight background-compute activity (badge + /data panel) | regression | P1 | journey replays end-to-end; all expects hold | journey replayed end-to-end; all expects held | PASS | reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/J-09-verify.png |
| UT-J-05 | J-05: Aggregates are precomputed at ingest, never on the fly | regression | P1 | See journey Acceptance below | Steps 1/2/4 independently live-verified via a real ~18m20s in-app backfill (2010-11-16); step 3 (backend restart) corroborated by same-day, unchanged-code-path evidence (Addendum 25/26) rather than re-executed | PASS | `reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/UT-J-05-result.png` |
| UT-J-07 | J-07: Heavy aggregates never take the service down | regression | P1 | See journey Acceptance below | Steps 1/3 independently live-verified via the SAME backfill's finalize-tail forward-aggregate warm + 741/741 health polls + VmPeak sample; step 2 restated (not re-scored) per dispatch; step 4 (fault injection) corroborated by same-day, unchanged-code-path evidence (Addendum 26) rather than re-executed | PASS | `reports/qa/goal-ops-hardening-iter-60-evidence/UT-J-07-result.png` |
