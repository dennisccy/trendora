# AI Multi-Agent Dev Chain

A reusable framework for running phased software development with Claude AI agents. The chain handles the full lifecycle: planning, implementation, review, UI validation, QA, audit, and release.

## What This Is

A collection of:
- **14 Claude agent definitions** covering the full dev lifecycle, UI visibility, per-iteration summary, and an auto-recorded product demo
- **18 automation shell scripts** orchestrating an 11-step pipeline plus an on-demand demo viewer
- **5 security hooks** guarding against supply-chain attacks, dangerous commands, and vague artifacts
- **9 skills** providing reusable methodologies for UI analysis, test design, and doc updates
- **18 report templates** for consistent handoffs across all agents
- **A modular CLAUDE.md system** (core rules, workflow, project config, anti-patterns, architecture docs)

The chain has checkpoint/resume, quota-exhaustion auto-retry, and a verdict-gated pipeline where each stage must pass before the next runs.

For comprehensive framework documentation, see [`.claude/architecture/`](.claude/architecture/README.md).

## Modes

The framework supports two modes:

**Phase mode** (the original) — you author phase specs in `docs/phases/` and run them one at a time through the 11-step pipeline. Each phase is a discrete, gated unit of work with a human-defined scope. Use this when you have a clear roadmap and want a human gate between every phase. Entry point: `./scripts/automation/run-phase.sh <phase-name>`.

**Goal mode** (added later, parallel to phase mode) — you author `docs/goal.md` once with **Must-have user journeys** and **Anti-goals**, then run `./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`. The system loops `decompose → execute → evaluate` adaptively (lean cycle for small changes, full 11-step pipeline for risky ones) until an AI evaluator declares the goal achieved or a hard halt fires (max iterations, stall, regression). Quota exhaustion does NOT halt the loop — it pauses and auto-resumes when quota resets. Use this when you want autonomous, unattended development against a fixed product target. See [`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`](docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md) and [`.claude/architecture/goal-mode.md`](.claude/architecture/goal-mode.md).

The two modes share all agents and skills. They write to disjoint artifact namespaces (`runs/<phase>/` vs `runs/goal-session-<sid>/`) so you can use both in the same project without collision.

### CLI Provider (Claude or Codex)

Both modes can run on either **Claude Code** (default) or **OpenAI Codex CLI** — pass `--cli claude|codex` to either entry script. A single canonical asset source under `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `policy/`, and `config/` is rendered into per-CLI trees (`.claude/`, `.codex/`) on first run; nothing is duplicated. Goal mode pins the choice in `session.json`; phase mode is per-run. Full guide in [`docs/cli-providers.md`](docs/cli-providers.md).

#### Multi-CLI — deferred / TODO

The multi-CLI infrastructure is in place and the Claude path is verified non-regressing at the script level. The following are intentionally **not yet done** — each needs an API-token budget or a heavier cleanup pass:

- [ ] **Real end-to-end Claude no-regression run.** Run a full phase with `--cli claude` and diff every artifact against a pre-migration baseline. (Script-level + semantic-equivalence checks pass; a real token-burning run is the final gate.)
- [ ] **Real Codex end-to-end run + hardening.** `_codex_invoke` quota/error regexes in `lib/quota-retry.sh` are best-guess. First real `--cli codex` run will reveal the actual OpenAI rate-limit/error wording to match. Expect 1–2 tightening passes.
- [ ] **Codex stream parsing.** `lib/codex_stream_renderer.py` handles several plausible event shapes; confirm against real `codex exec --json` NDJSON and trim to the actual schema.
- [ ] **Retire legacy `.claude/` files from git.** `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/*`, `.claude/skills/*` are still tracked and regenerated on sync (producing small, functionally-identical cosmetic diffs). Move them to `.gitignore` and `git rm --cached` once the Claude no-regression run passes.
- [ ] **`hooks/lib/normalize-input.sh` / `normalize-output.sh`.** Planned shims so one hook script reads a uniform input schema and writes a uniform allow/block decision across both CLIs. Currently each hook still handles per-CLI env vars itself.
- [ ] **Architecture docs.** `.claude/architecture/*.md` still describe the pre-migration Claude-only layout; update for the neutral source + adapter model.
- [ ] **MCP servers in neutral source.** `policy/mcp-servers.yaml` is a stub; Claude MCP/plugins currently live in `adapters/claude/passthrough/`. Promote to neutral source when a shared MCP definition is actually needed.
- [ ] **Mixed-CLI runs (per-agent override).** Architecture supports a per-agent `cli:` field in `agent.yaml`; not wired up. Deferred until there's a real use case.
- [ ] **Codex profiles for non-default tiers.** Generated `.codex/config.toml` sticks to a single profile.

## Quick Start

**1. Add this repo to your project** (as a submodule, subtree, or direct copy).

**2. Define your project goal.** Create `docs/goal.md` from `templates/project-goal.md`.

**3. Fill in `.claude/project-template.md`.** Configure your stack, test commands, and architecture rules.

**4. Write a phase spec.** Use `templates/phase-spec.md`. Save to `docs/phases/phase-1-<name>.md`.

**5. Run.**

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-phase.sh phase-1
```

See [`.claude/architecture/adoption-guide.md`](.claude/architecture/adoption-guide.md) for the full adoption procedure.

### Goal Mode Quick Start

Goal mode skips per-phase authoring. You write a single `docs/goal.md` with extra sections for must-have user journeys and anti-goals, then run a continuous loop until an AI evaluator declares the goal achieved.

**1. Author `docs/goal.md` from `templates/project-goal.md`**, including the **Must-have user journeys** and **Anti-goals** sections (required for goal mode; phase mode ignores them). Optionally fill the **Product Shape** section (a navigation sketch + the list of *canonical values*) — it seeds the coherence blueprint and is the best defense against the same number showing different values on different pages.

**2. Configure `.claude/project-template.md`** the same way you would for phase mode.

**3. Run.**

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app
```

Optional flags: `--max-iter N` (cap, default 30), `--stall-window N` (default 3), `--auto-release` (opens PR from `goal/<sid>` branch on `GOAL_ACHIEVED`), `--push-per-iter` / `--no-push-per-iter` (per-iter commits land on a single per-session branch; default ON), `--push-branch <name>` (override the default `goal/<sid>` name), `--auto-approve-blueprint` (skip the one-time blueprint review), `--resume`, `--reset`, `--acknowledge-regression`.

After baseline, the loop **pauses once** (`AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL`) for you to review the drafted coherence blueprint at `runs/goal-session-my-app/state/blueprint.md` (~3 min: sane navigation? every shared value has one source?). Edit it if needed and `--resume` (resuming counts as approval), or pass `--auto-approve-blueprint` to skip the pause entirely. From then on the run is unattended again, and a `coherence-auditor` enforces the blueprint every iteration.

**4. Inspect** `runs/goal-session-my-app/summary.md` when the loop halts. Halt verdicts: `GOAL_ACHIEVED` (success), `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `STALLED`, `REGRESSION_HALT`, `ABORTED`, `AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL` (resumable pause for blueprint review), `AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH` (resumable pause — push-per-iter is on but `origin` won't authenticate; the run offers `gh auth login` when interactive, else `gh auth login && gh auth setup-git` then `--resume`).

Because per-iter push is on by default, goal mode checks at startup that a push to `origin` would authenticate, so an expired GitHub session can't stall a mid-run push on a credential prompt. Pushes are also run with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so they fail fast (non-fatally) instead of hanging. Skip the startup check with `CHAIN_SKIP_GITHUB_PREFLIGHT=true`.

Quota exhaustion is NOT a halt — the loop pauses and auto-resumes when the quota resets.

See [`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`](docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md) for the full guide.

## Pipeline (11 Steps)

```
Phase spec (docs/phases/<phase>.md)
    |
    v
 1. orchestrator       --> plan.md
    |
    v
 2. qa (generate)      --> test-plan.md
    |
    v
 3. developer+reviewer --> dev-handoff + review-report  (loop: max 3 attempts)
    |
    v
 4. ui-impact-analyst  --> user-visible-changes + ui-surface-map
    |
    v
 5. ui-test-designer   --> ui-test-plan + what-to-click          [frontend only]
    |
    v
 6. browser-qa-agent   --> ui-test-results                       [frontend only]
    |
    v
 6.5 demo-narrator      --> demo-script + demo-results + screenshots [frontend only, showcase]
    |
    v
 7. qa (validate)      --> qa-report                    (loop: max 3 attempts)
    |
    v
 8. ux-regression      --> ux-regression-report                  [frontend only]
    |
    v
 9. auditor            --> audit-report                 (loop: max 2 attempts)
    |
    v
10. phase-closure      --> closure-verdict
    |
    v
10.5 iteration-summarizer --> iteration-summary.md + summary.html
    |
    v
11. release-manager    --> summary.json + branch + commit + PR
```

Steps 5, 6, 6.5, and 8 are skipped for backend-only phases (`Frontend Present: no`).

Step 6.5 (the demo) is **showcase, not gate** — a failed step is a soft note, never a hard pipeline fail. It re-uses the app already booted by browser QA in the same window (idempotent `ensure_services_running`), so no second app boot.

## Iteration Summary + HTML Report

Step 10.5 produces a single conclusive per-iteration markdown at
`reports/phase-<phase>-iteration-summary.md`. It answers the four questions a
developer actually has after a run: what was done, what's left, what direction
the project is moving (improving / holding / stalling / regressing — for goal
mode), and what the next step is. This MD is the source of truth.

A deterministic HTML renderer turns that MD into a self-contained
`reports/phase-<phase>-summary.html` (inline CSS, base64-embedded screenshots,
no remote refs). Goal mode also writes a session-level
`reports/goal-session-<sid>-index.html` that lists every iteration as a card
with a journey progress matrix.

Regenerate either or both at any time:

```bash
bash scripts/automation/render-summary.sh <phase-id>                  # rebuild MD via agent + render HTML
bash scripts/automation/render-summary.sh <phase-id> --no-resummarize # re-render HTML only (no API tokens)
bash scripts/automation/render-summary.sh --session-index <sid>       # re-render goal-mode session index
```

## Non-Technical Summary & Live Demo

The framework writes a layered view of every iteration so that **anyone — not just developers — can understand what was built and decide what's next.** Three things happen, automatically, on every iteration:

1. **Plain-language layer in the iteration summary.** The iteration-summary HTML (the page at `reports/phase-<phase>-summary.html`) now *leads* with a `## In plain words` block: *What you can do now / What changed this time / What's next*. No jargon, no file names, no journey IDs. The technical sections (Direction, What was done, Quick verify, Artifacts) are kept exactly as before — they just sit below, **collapsed by default**, for when a developer wants to drill down.

2. **An auto-recorded narrated demo (Step 6.5).** Right after browser QA — in the same app-up window — the framework walks the **whole working product so far** in a real browser, captures one captioned screenshot per step, and assembles them into a "Watch it work" gallery on the same page. Steps that were added or visibly changed this iteration are flagged `[NEW]`. Showcase, not QA — a failed step is a soft note in `demo-results.md`, never a hard pipeline fail.

3. **A continuously-updated "Project story so far" + GOAL_ACHIEVED wrap** (goal mode only). The `iteration-summarizer` agent also maintains `runs/goal-session-<sid>/state/project-story.md` — one flowing plain-language narrative of how the product grew, rewritten each iteration so it reads end-to-end. The session index HTML (`reports/goal-session-<sid>-index.html`) leads with this story plus the latest demo gallery. When `goal-evaluator` finally returns `GOAL_ACHIEVED`, the framework emits a one-time polished `goal-session-<sid>-delivered.html` — a celebratory "what we delivered" page with the final walkthrough embedded, linked from a banner on the session index.

### Watch your app — how to run & what to expect

Watch your built app run in a **real Chrome window** while plain-language
explanations print in your terminal. You press **Enter** to step through it —
like someone sitting next to you demoing the product.

```bash
# Live walkthrough of the WHOLE product built so far (every working feature)
./scripts/automation/demo.sh <session-id> --session-live

# Live walkthrough of a single iteration
./scripts/automation/demo.sh <iter-id> --live          # e.g. goal-money-iter-3 (or phase-1)

# Just open the recorded picture gallery — no live window
./scripts/automation/demo.sh <id>                      # phase OR session id
./scripts/automation/demo.sh --latest                  # most recent gallery
./scripts/automation/demo.sh <sid> --delivered         # the GOAL_ACHIEVED "delivered" wrap
```

**What to expect (live):** A Chrome window opens. For each step the terminal
prints a short, non-technical explanation and the matching on-screen element is
highlighted; press **Enter in this terminal** (not the browser) to perform that
step and watch it happen, then the terminal tells you what to notice. At the end
the window stays open until you press Enter one last time. It never types on its
own — you control the pace. A step looks like:

```
── Step 02/06 ─ Open the new-report form  [NEW]
   We open the form to create a report.
   ▶ Press Enter (in this terminal) to perform this step…
   ↳ Notice: a blank form titled "New Report".
```

**Prerequisites & notes:**
- Live mode opens a real browser window, so it needs a display. It works over SSH X11 forwarding (may lag a little — that's normal). On a fresh machine it prints the one `python3 -m pip install --user playwright` command if Playwright isn't set up yet.
- The app is started automatically if it isn't already running.
- The first live run prepares the walkthrough once (a few seconds); repeat runs reuse it and open instantly. Add `--reauthor` to rebuild it after big changes.

**If you can't see a window** (headless / remote without X): open the recorded
gallery instead (`./scripts/automation/demo.sh <id>`), or set
`CHAIN_DEMO_LIVE_FALLBACK_RECORD=true` to auto-record instead of going live.

**Optional touches:** `CHAIN_DEMO_VIDEO=true` also saves a video of the run;
`CHAIN_DEMO_CAPTION=true` overlays the explanation on the page itself.

**Troubleshooting:** a `⚠ couldn't find that element — skipping` line is expected
and harmless — the demo just continues to the next step. *"Nothing to show yet"*
means it's an early or backend-only iteration with no features to walk through.

For more, see [`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`](docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md), [`runs/SCHEMA.md`](runs/SCHEMA.md) (artifact registry), and [`.claude/architecture/artifacts.md`](.claude/architecture/artifacts.md) (producer/consumer matrix).

Screenshots of the rendered HTML appear in this section after your first iteration runs end-to-end — the artifacts are real, not mocked.

## Faster Iterations

Three always-on improvements shorten every iteration:

- **Tier 1 prompt polish.** Per-agent prompts no longer re-read `CLAUDE.md` (it's auto-loaded into the system prompt) and the duplicated "Token and Questioning Policy" boilerplate that paraphrased `.claude/core.md` has been removed from every agent body. Each call is smaller and the static prefix is more cache-friendly. **Behavior is unchanged** — same artifacts, same verdicts.
- **Per-agent `--effort` overrides.** Reasoning-heavy agents (`developer`, `reviewer`, `auditor`, `orchestrator`, `goal-decomposer`, `goal-evaluator`, `browser-qa-agent`, `demo-narrator`) stay at `--effort max`. Structured / mechanical agents (`release-manager`, `qa`, `ui-test-designer`, `ui-impact-analyst`, `phase-closure-auditor`) drop to `--effort medium` for shorter responses without losing what they need to do their job. Set `CHAIN_DISABLE_EFFORT_OVERRIDE=true` to restore `--effort max` for every agent.
- **Parallel post-dev fanout.** After Step 3 finishes, the safe post-dev pairs run **in parallel** with shared services:

```
                        (Step 3: dev + review)
                                │
                                ▼
                  ┌─────────────── shared app boot ──────────────┐
                  │                                              │
  ┌─ Branch A (UI chain, sequential) ─┐    ┌─ Branch B (QA) ─┐
  │  ui-impact   →  ui-test-design    │    │  qa-validate    │
  │     →  browser-qa  →  demo        │    │                 │
  └──────────────┬───────────────────┘    └──────┬──────────┘
                 │                               │
                 └────────── wait both ──────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
                    Step 8: ux-regression   →   close + finalize
```

The fanout writes a single `post_dev_parallel_complete` checkpoint after both branches succeed. If Branch B's QA verdict fails, the existing sequential Step 7 retry loop still runs (dev → review → qa, up to 3 attempts) — so the self-heal path is preserved. If either branch is interrupted by signal or hits quota, the parent propagates the same exit code and the next resume re-runs the fanout from scratch. Backend-only phases (`Frontend Present: no`) skip the fanout and run the sequential Step 4 → 5 → 6 → 6.5 → 7 blocks instead.

Expected wall-clock reduction over the pre-parallel pipeline: **~30–50% for full phase iterations**, **~15–25% for lean goal-mode iterations** (lean has nothing to parallelise; the gain comes entirely from Tier 1 polish + `--effort` drops).

```bash
CHAIN_DISABLE_EFFORT_OVERRIDE=true ./scripts/automation/run-phase.sh phase-1   # escape hatch: restore --effort max
```

Implementation notes for advanced users: the parallel runner is in [`scripts/automation/lib/parallel.sh`](scripts/automation/lib/parallel.sh); shared services are coordinated via the `CHAIN_SHARED_SERVICES=true` env contract that `browser-qa-phase.sh`, `qa-phase.sh`, and `demo-phase.sh` honor; per-agent effort is resolved by `agent_permissions.py effort <agent>`. Telemetry (`CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS=true`, default) records per-agent input/output/cache/cost so you can quantify the gain on your own workloads.

## Goal Mode Pipeline

Goal mode wraps the phase pipeline in an outer loop driven by an AI evaluator.

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Iteration name `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>` is used as the "phase name" so existing scripts and agents need no changes. Artifacts isolate naturally under disjoint namespaces.

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Model Tier | Pipeline Step | What it does |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| `orchestrator` | strong | 1 | Reads phase spec, writes execution plan |
| `developer` | strong | 3 | TDD implementation (backend + frontend) |
| `reviewer` | standard | 3 | Code review against spec and architecture |
| `qa` | light | 2, 7 | Test plan generation (mode 1) and QA validation (mode 2) |
| `auditor` | strong | 9 | Skeptical post-QA audit, may apply critical fixes |
| `release-manager` | light | 11 | Git branch, commit, push, PR |
| `product-manager` | strong | (optional) | Architecture planning before phase spec |
| `ui-impact-analyst` | standard | 4 | Maps code changes to user-visible UI surfaces |
| `ui-test-designer` | standard | 5 | Creates UI test plans and operator verification guides |
| `browser-qa-agent` | standard | 6 | Executes browser tests via Chrome MCP |
| `ux-regression-reviewer` | standard | 8 | Checks UI evolved with capabilities, flags regressions |
| `phase-closure-auditor` | standard | 10 | Final gate: validates all artifacts exist and are non-vague |
| `iteration-summarizer` | light | 10.5 | Synthesizes the per-iteration summary MD (what was done / left / direction) that drives the HTML report; also maintains the cumulative `project-story.md` and writes the one-time `delivered.md` wrap on `GOAL_ACHIEVED` |
| `demo-narrator` | standard | 6.5 | Authors a machine-executable demo-script (steps + narration) from the iteration's verified flows; the deterministic Playwright runner (`lib/demo_runner.py`) executes it to produce the recorded "Watch it work" gallery and the live walkthrough. Showcase, not gate. |
| `goal-decomposer` | strong | (goal mode) | Reads goal + state, writes next iteration spec, picks lean/full depth; drafts the blueprint at baseline |
| `goal-evaluator` | strong | (goal mode) | Skeptical done/regression/stall judgment, updates journey-history; vetoes GOAL_ACHIEVED on COHERENCE-FAIL |
| `coherence-auditor` | standard | (goal mode) | Audits each iteration's diff against the blueprint (information architecture + data contract); hard-fails only on objective drift |

Model tiers are defined in `config/agent-models.yaml`. Change assignments there and run `./scripts/automation/sync-agent-models.sh`.

## Security

- **Supply-chain gate**: Every `pip install`, `npm install`, `git clone`, and `curl | bash` is intercepted. Policy in `config/install-security-policy.json`.
- **Command guard**: Dangerous commands (rm -rf /, force-push main, credential reads) are blocked.
- **Post-edit lint**: Edited Python files get syntax-checked. TypeScript files get type-checked.
- **Artifact quality**: Phase reports are checked for vague placeholder content.
- **Stop check**: Warns if a phase run is in-progress when the session ends.

## Subrepo Usage

This framework is designed to be added to project repos as a submodule or subtree. Framework files live under `.claude/`, `scripts/`, `config/`, and `templates/` -- directories that do not conflict with typical project layouts. Project-specific docs go in `docs/`.

## Architecture Documentation

- **Framework docs**: [`.claude/architecture/`](.claude/architecture/README.md) -- how this framework works
- **Project docs**: `docs/architecture/` -- what the project has built (auto-updated per phase)

## Token Optimization — Pending Work

Tier 1 (safe, mechanical) shipped in commit `15507dc` (May 2026): telemetry on by default, CLAUDE.md double-load removed from 15 prompt sites, orchestrator no longer re-reads `.claude/architecture/*.md`, goal-mode `evaluator-log.md` / `lessons.md` pre-trimmed and inlined, orphan `ui-workflow-inference` skill wired up.

The items below are deliberately deferred — do them in order, with a real telemetry baseline before each.

### Step 0 — Establish a baseline (do this first)

With `CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS` now defaulting to true, the next phase or goal iteration writes per-call usage to:
- Phase mode: `runs/<phase>/trace/trace.jsonl`
- Goal mode: `runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl`

Analyze with: `python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py runs/<phase>/trace/trace.jsonl` — gives per-agent input/output/cache/cost breakdown. Without this baseline, everything below is guesswork.

### Tier 1 polish (low-risk leftovers)

- [x] **Shipped** — Remove the duplicated "Token and Questioning Policy" footer from each agent file (`.claude/agents/*.md`). Agent-specific bullets are kept (e.g., developer.md "Ask only about: schema decisions, lifecycle states…"); generic paraphrasing of `core.md` is gone. See `agents/<name>/body.md`.
- [x] **Shipped** — Drop `CLAUDE.md` from the "Always read first" list in the 11 remaining agent files. CLAUDE.md is auto-loaded into the system prompt; each agent now has a friendly one-line reassurance instead of re-reading the file.
- [ ] Inline only the sections each agent needs from `.claude/project-template.md` — release-manager needs the never-commit list (5 lines); developer needs most of it. Add a helper in `lib/common.sh` that emits the right slice per agent. (Deferred until measured token win is meaningful.)

### Tier 2 (needs baseline data first)

- [x] **Shipped — Per-agent `--effort` overrides.** Resolved per agent via `lib/agent_permissions.py effort <agent>`. `developer`, `reviewer`, `auditor`, `orchestrator`, `goal-decomposer`, `goal-evaluator`, `browser-qa-agent`, and `demo-narrator` stay at `--effort max`. `release-manager`, `qa`, `ui-test-designer`, `phase-closure-auditor`, and `ui-impact-analyst` drop to `--effort medium`. Escape hatch: `CHAIN_DISABLE_EFFORT_OVERRIDE=true`.
- [ ] **Move orchestrator from Opus → Sonnet** (`config/agent-models.yaml`). Plan-writing is structured-output work. A/B against 2–3 historical phases — revert if plan quality drops.
- [ ] **Move goal-decomposer from Opus → Sonnet.** Same rationale as orchestrator. Keep goal-evaluator on Opus (skeptical adversarial judgment).
- [ ] **Skip `generate-test-plan.sh` (Step 2/11) when the spec already lists test scenarios.** Need a clear heuristic for "spec has tests" — don't skip silently.
- [ ] **Cap audit-failure full-rerun.** `run-phase.sh:649-679` re-runs dev + review + QA on audit fail. If telemetry shows that path firing often, switch to fix-only mode.

### Pipeline parallelism (shipped)

- [x] **Parallel post-dev fanout.** Branch A (ui-impact → ui-test-design → browser-qa → demo) runs in parallel with Branch B (qa-validate), with shared services. See the [Faster Iterations](#faster-iterations) section. Default for every phase with a frontend; backend-only phases run sequentially.

### Tier 3 (don't touch unless data forces)

- ~~Downgrade qa below Haiku~~ — qa drives Chrome MCP browser flows; lower may misread DOM. If browser checks regress, **upgrade** to Sonnet, not down.
- ~~Merge ui-impact-analyst + ui-test-designer + ux-regression-reviewer~~ — each is a separate skeptical source the closure auditor depends on. Not worth losing the independence for one Sonnet call's worth of savings.
- ~~Eliminate retries~~ — they exist for quality reasons. Only consider capping the audit-failure full-rerun (see Tier 2 above).

### How to know when to stop

If a 30-iteration goal session costs <$X and a phase costs <$Y (your numbers), it's not worth more optimization — invest the time in features instead.

## Pipeline Hardening (Strengthen Claude-only Weak Spots) — Pending Work

Benchmark evidence (May 2026) shows Opus 4.7 trails GPT-5.5 on Terminal-Bench 2.0 by 13.3 points and emits ~3.5x more output tokens per task. The decision is to keep this project Claude-only and harden the pipeline at those weak spots rather than introduce a second model.

### Shipped (or in this branch)

- [x] **Test-failure digest script** (`scripts/automation/lib/test_failure_digest.py`) — distills raw pytest/jest/vitest/mocha output into a structured markdown digest. Invoked by the `qa` agent on test failure; the `developer` agent reads it first on retry. Removes the "grep through 500-line log" task from the model — exactly the work GPT-5.5 leads on.
- [x] **Reviewer YAML schema + token budget** — replaces the prose review-report format with a verdict line + YAML structured findings + optional brief detailed findings. Hard caps: PASS ≤ 200 tokens, PASS_WITH_NOTES ≤ 400, FAIL ≤ 800 (vs. ~1200–2500 today).

### Deferred — do these one at a time, with telemetry before/after

- [ ] **Move `reviewer` from Opus to Sonnet 4.6** (or Haiku 4.5 for cheap quick reviews). Different model in the same family captures a meaningful subset of blind spots at lower cost. `sync-agent-models.sh` already supports per-agent model assignment. Ship after the YAML schema is stable so the cheaper model has a tighter target. See also Token Optimization Tier 2 for the orchestrator equivalent.
- [ ] **Extended-thinking on `auditor` + adversarial framing.** Set `thinking.budget_tokens` for the auditor and prepend "assume the implementation is buggy and find why." Extended thinking is Claude's largest unexploited reasoning lever and directly attacks the "long-context-large-system" weakness on benchmarks like SWE-Bench Pro. Test budget vs. latency on 2–3 phases before rolling out broadly.
- [ ] **Goal-mode iteration-state synthesis.** Have `goal-evaluator` produce a fresh `iteration-state.md` after each iteration, prepended to the next iteration's context. Don't rely on the model's recall of `journey-history.json`. Combats long-loop context drift — which is where Opus 4.7 weakens most relative to GPT-5.5. Touches goal-mode internals; pick it up only after the first two deferred items are stable.

### How to know when each is worth doing

For each deferred item, the trigger is a measured regression — not a guess:

| Item | Signal that says "do it now" |
|------|------------------------------|
| Reviewer → Sonnet | Reviewer output tokens still > Sonnet's typical budget after the YAML schema change |
| Auditor extended-thinking | Auditor returns PASS on phases that ship with bugs (audit gap data from real phases) |
| Iteration-state synthesis | Goal-mode iterations show drift symptoms — repeated work, forgotten journeys, or loops that re-test fixed regressions |

Without these signals, all three are speculative work — better spent on features.

## Known Limitations

1. **Service bootstrap**: QA expects `CHAIN_START_BACKEND_CMD` or `scripts/start-backend.sh`.
2. **Claude Code only**: Hooks and agent definitions are Claude Code-specific.
3. **Model tier costs**: Assumes access to Claude API with multiple model tiers.
4. **No CI integration**: Pipeline is CLI-only. GitHub Actions integration is not included.
5. **Chrome MCP optional for phase mode**: Browser checks require Chrome MCP. Without it, browser tests are skipped.
6. **Chrome MCP required for goal mode**: The goal-evaluator anchors its `GOAL_ACHIEVED` decision on browser-qa journey results. Without Chrome MCP, browser tests are SKIPPED and the evaluator will likely emit `ESCALATE` indefinitely.
