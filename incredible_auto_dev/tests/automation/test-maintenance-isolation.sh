# test-maintenance-isolation.sh — full review depth WITHOUT application services.
#
# THE PROBLEM: "full depth" and "boot the app" were the same thing. Four separate
# mechanisms conspire to start services/browsers for a backend-only maintenance
# iteration, verified against the implementation:
#   1. detect_frontend_in_plan force-returns 0 whenever CHAIN_GOAL_TARGET_JOURNEYS
#      is non-empty — overriding a spec's "Frontend Present: no";
#   2. run-phase.sh's post-dev fanout calls _boot_shared_services (backend +
#      frontend start commands, QA_FRONTEND_REQUIRED=yes);
#   3. browser-qa-phase.sh drives the deterministic replay lane, whose partitioner
#      routes TARGET journeys as well as Required-still-passing ones — so an empty
#      required set does NOT make an iteration replay-safe;
#   4. qa-phase.sh self-boots the backend via ensure_services_running (and also
#      registers it as the quota-retry pre-hook), independent of any frontend.
# For a repair iteration on a damaged database — where backend boot warmup itself
# writes derived rows — that is a correctness hazard.
#
# Under test: goal_maintenance_isolation_required (lib/common.sh) as the single
# shared predicate, plus fail-closed refusals at every forbidden path. Default OFF.
#
# Host-safe by construction: no service, browser, or engine is started. Behaviour
# is proven by executing the real predicate and the real ensure_services_running
# chokepoint, and by structural assertions for the branch wiring.
