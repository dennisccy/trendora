### NEED-1 · `/goal-init` intake interview
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** goal.md quality decides everything downstream, but adopters author it by
  hand from a template with no guidance loop. Vague journeys → infinite review loops
  (anti-pattern #1) and products that miss intent.
- **Current state:** authoring guidance only in `templates/project-goal.md` comments and
  `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`. The engine validates structure at start:
  `validate_goal_file` at `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh:533-573` (called ~`:709`)
  checks: file exists, `## Must-have user journeys` heading, `## Anti-goals` heading,
  ≥1 `- **J-NN:` entry, ≥1 concrete non-placeholder anti-goal. Slash-command format:
  see `commands/goal.md` / `commands/goal-status.md` (frontmatter + instruction body).
- **Change spec:**
  1. New `commands/goal-init.md`: interviews the user section-by-section in the order of
     `templates/project-goal.md` (Vision → Target Users → Success Criteria → Key
     Capabilities → Product Shape → Must-have journeys with J-NN IDs, numbered steps,
     and an observable Acceptance line each → Anti-goals). One topic at a time;
     multiple-choice options where sensible; conversational (no special tools assumed).
  2. After the interview, play back "here is what I understood" — one line per journey
     plus anti-goals verbatim — and get explicit confirmation BEFORE writing
     `docs/goal.md`. If a goal.md already exists, offer update mode (show diff of what
     would change) instead of overwrite.
  3. Final self-check: the four `validate_goal_file` rules above + no leftover `<...>`
     template placeholders. (Once NEED-3 ships, run `goal_lint.py` instead.)
  4. New `skills/goal-authoring.md`: the interview script, playback format, and the
     structural checklist — shared later by `/goal-lint` (NEED-4).
- **DoD:** `/goal-init` in a scratch repo produces a goal.md that passes
  `validate_goal_file`; playback-before-write and update-mode behavior are specified in
  the command body; skill and command are mirrored into `.claude/`.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude && ls
  .claude/commands/goal-init.md .claude/skills/goal-authoring.md &&
  ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `commands/goal-init.md` (new), `skills/goal-authoring.md` (new),
  mirrors via sync.
- **Rollback:** delete the two new files + mirrors; nothing else references them.
- **Note (2026-07-07):** implementation complete — `commands/goal-init.md` +
  `skills/goal-authoring.md` written, mirrors rendered, Verify block + full eval
  suite green (78 pass / 0 fail). Left IN-PROGRESS per G8 (Effort M, no
  self-certification). Fresh-session verification remaining: run `/goal-init` in a
  scratch repo, confirm the produced goal.md passes `validate_goal_file` and the
  playback-before-write + update-mode behaviors match the command body, then flip
  to DONE and archive per §2.8.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line.
  Verify block re-run green — sync wrote 0 (mirrors drift-free), both mirror files
  present, evals 78 pass / 0 fail. Scratch-repo test-drive (fresh git repo with the
  rendered command/skill/template copied in): CREATE round produced a 3-journey
  goal.md that passes the real `validate_goal_file` (function extracted verbatim
  from `run-goal.sh`; harness red-green-tested first) with zero `<...>` placeholders;
  transcript shows interview → playback → explicit "yes" → write, and both scripted
  vague answers ("popular", "works properly") were pushed to observable per the
  skill. UPDATE round on that goal.md (with an injected `AUTO:journeys` block holding
  J-04): diff-shaped playback (old → new, unchanged by name), explicit "yes" before
  edit, git diff exactly two surgical hunks, AUTO block and J-01..03 byte-identical
  (md5-verified), new journey correctly assigned J-05, validator still passes.

### NEED-2 · Quickstart names `/goal-init` first
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** even after NEED-1 ships, adopters following the quickstart will still
  hand-author goal.md and never discover the interview.
- **Current state:** `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md` "4-step setup" (~line 18) says to
  author goal.md manually from the template.
- **Change spec:** setup step 1 becomes "run `/goal-init` inside Claude Code (interview →
  drafted goal.md)"; manual authoring stays as the alternative path. Add `/goal-init` to
  the quickstart's See-also list (~line 302).
- **DoD:** quickstart names `/goal-init` before manual authoring.
- **Verify:** `grep -n "goal-init" docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md` (≥2 hits).
- **Files:** `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`.
- **Rollback:** revert the doc edit.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, self-certified per §2 step 7 — Effort S):** setup step 1 now
  opens with "**Recommended:** run `/goal-init` inside Claude Code" (interview →
  drafted goal.md) with manual template authoring kept as the explicit alternative
  path; `/goal-init` added to See-also linking `commands/goal-init.md`. Verify block
  green: grep shows 2 hits (step 1 + See-also); full eval suite 78 pass / 0 fail.

### NEED-3 · Deterministic goal linter (`goal_lint.py`)
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** `validate_goal_file` checks presence, not quality. Vague acceptance
  criteria are the documented #1 failure mode and nothing catches them before a session
  burns iterations on them.
- **Current state:** structure checks only (`run-goal.sh:533-573`). Anti-goal bullet
  parsing lives at `run-goal.sh:558-572`; journey-block regexes exist in
  `scripts/automation/lib/goal_gate.py` (~`:158`, `_journey_blocks` /
  `_JOURNEY_HEADER_RE`). Lib self-test convention: see `lib/checkpoint.sh` self-test
  and `run-evals.sh` §2 registry.
- **Change spec:**
  1. New `scripts/automation/lib/goal_lint.py` (stdlib-only). Checks: duplicate J-NN
     IDs; journey missing numbered steps or an `Acceptance` line; leftover `<...>`
     template placeholders; vague words in Acceptance lines ("works well", "fast",
     "properly", "intuitive", "user-friendly", "correctly"); anti-goals phrased as
     aspirations with no checkable condition; empty Product Shape section while ≥2
     journeys reference the same value/metric. Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 warnings,
     2 structural errors. Subcommand `self-test` with fixtures for each rule.
  2. Warn-only engine wiring: in `run-goal.sh` immediately after the
     `validate_goal_file` call (~`:709`), behind `CHAIN_GOAL_LINT` (default `true`):
     `python3 "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/goal_lint.py" "$GOAL_FILE" || true` — print warnings,
     NEVER block the engine (style must not gate execution).
  3. Register in `run-evals.sh` §2: `goal_lint.py self-test`.
- **DoD:** self-test green; engine start on a deliberately vague goal.md prints warnings
  and proceeds; evals green.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/lib/goal_lint.py self-test && bash -n
  scripts/automation/run-goal.sh && ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `scripts/automation/lib/goal_lint.py` (new), `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`
  (2-3 lines), `scripts/automation/run-evals.sh` (1 line).
- **Rollback:** remove the run-goal.sh call and the eval line; the lib is inert alone.
- **Note (2026-07-07, implementer):** implemented per change spec; Verify block green
  locally (self-test + `bash -n` + evals 79-pass), and a sandbox engine start on a
  deliberately vague goal.md printed 6 warnings then proceeded to iteration 0
  (`CHAIN_GOAL_LINT=false` control run printed none). Left IN-PROGRESS pending
  fresh-session verification per G8.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line.
  Verify block re-run green: `goal_lint.py self-test` passed, `bash -n run-goal.sh`
  clean, evals 79 pass / 0 fail (self-test registered at `run-evals.sh:127`; fixtures
  cover all six rules plus the 0/1/2 exit-code contract and negative cases). Wiring
  confirmed at `run-goal.sh:709-713` — immediately after `validate_goal_file`, behind
  `CHAIN_GOAL_LINT` default-true, `|| true`. Sandbox engine start (fresh framework
  copy, dispatch pointed at a dead local endpoint so zero API tokens spent): a
  deliberately vague goal.md printed 5 warnings (vague-acceptance ×2, placeholder,
  aspirational-anti-goal, product-shape-empty — the last confirmed firing on a real
  file, not just fixtures) then proceeded to Iteration 0 / Step 1 baseline-decomposer
  dispatch; `CHAIN_GOAL_LINT=false` control run printed no lint output and proceeded
  identically. Intake tie-in: `/goal-init` flow test-driven in a second scratch repo
  (create-mode goal.md authored per `skills/goal-authoring.md`; interview
  self-answered — no live user in the verifying session): produced file passes the
  command's step-5 self-check (`goal_lint.py` exit 0, silent) and the real
  `validate_goal_file` at engine startup (reached "Initializing new session" →
  iteration 0 with no validation error).

### NEED-4 · `/goal-lint` LLM semantic pass
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** deterministic rules can't catch contradictions between journeys,
  unmeasurable acceptance phrased measurably, or risky surfaces (auth, payments,
  uploads) with no anti-goal coverage.
- **Current state:** no semantic review of goal.md exists anywhere.
- **Change spec:** new `commands/goal-lint.md`: (1) run
  `python3 scripts/automation/lib/goal_lint.py docs/goal.md` and show output; (2) apply
  the semantic checklist from `skills/goal-authoring.md` (NEED-1); (3) write findings to
  `reports/goal-lint.md` in the format: quoted line → problem → concrete suggested
  rewrite. REPORT-ONLY — the command must never edit goal.md (it is user-approval class
  per maintenance protocol §1).
- **DoD:** command exists + mirrored; body forbids editing goal.md; running it on the
  framework's own `docs/goal.md` produces a sane report.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude --check`
  after sync; manual run on `docs/goal.md`.
- **Files:** `commands/goal-lint.md` (new) + mirror.
- **Rollback:** delete the command + mirror.
- **Depends on:** NEED-3 (uses the linter), NEED-1 (shares the skill checklist).
- **Note (2026-07-07, implementer — Effort S, self-verified per §2.7):** command
  authored with the seven-check semantic checklist (journey contradictions,
  unobservable-but-measurably-phrased acceptance, guess-requiring steps,
  non-independent journeys, uncovered risky surfaces, keyword-fooling anti-goals,
  unmeasurable success criteria) drawn from `skills/goal-authoring.md` items 3/9/10
  plus the NEED-4 problem statement; body forbids editing goal.md and restricts
  writes to `reports/goal-lint.md` (allowed-tools has no Edit). Verify block green:
  mirror synced, `--check` OK, evals 79 pass / 0 fail. Sanity run on the framework's
  own meta `docs/goal.md` produced a sane `reports/goal-lint.md`: deterministic exit 2
  (`no-journeys` — expected, the file is the documented replace-me meta goal) shown
  verbatim, 2 semantic findings in the quoted-line → problem → paste-ready-rewrite
  format (missing anti-goal coverage for the supply-chain surface; no measurable
  success criterion), summary correctly identifies the file as documentation rather
  than a runnable contract; `docs/goal.md` untouched by the run.

### NEED-5 · Assumption ledger — writers
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** MED · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** the decomposer and evaluator make silent interpretation calls ("the spec
  is ambiguous about X, we chose Y") that the human never sees until the product is
  wrong. Judgment-rubrics §3 only covers the extreme case (STALLED on conflicting
  readings); everyday interpretation choices vanish.
- **Current state:** no assumptions artifact exists. The proven pattern for append-only
  session files is `lessons.md`: appended by the evaluator, pre-trimmed and inlined into
  prompts via `_tail_or_placeholder` (`run-goal.sh:520-525`), never read whole.
- **Change spec:**
  1. New session file `runs/goal-session-<sid>/state/assumptions.md`, append-only.
     Entry format: `## iter-<N> — <agent>` then `**Ambiguity:** …` / `**We chose:** …` /
     `**Reversible:** yes|no`.
  2. `agents/goal-decomposer/body.md`: add a rule (Rules section, ~`:189-199`) — when a
     spec decision required interpreting the goal, append an entry; zero entries is fine
     (signal only, no routine entries — same discipline as lessons).
  3. `agents/goal-evaluator/body.md`: add step "5b" beside the lessons step
     (~`:112-129`) — same, for scoring-time interpretations (e.g. "accepted truncated
     email as 'shows email'").
  4. Dispatch prompts: decomposer prompt block (`run-goal.sh:1241-1281`) and evaluator
     "Prior session state" block (~`:1523-1526`) gain the ledger path (append-target)
     plus an inlined tail via `_tail_or_placeholder`, exactly like `LESSONS_TAIL`.
  5. Version-bump both touched `agent.yaml` files; resync mirrors.
- **DoD:** rendered `.claude/agents/goal-{decomposer,evaluator}.md` contain the ledger
  instructions; both dispatch prompts reference the path; an absent ledger renders as
  placeholder text (no crash); evals green.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude && grep -l
  assumptions .claude/agents/goal-decomposer.md .claude/agents/goal-evaluator.md &&
  bash -n scripts/automation/run-goal.sh && ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `agents/goal-decomposer/body.md`, `agents/goal-evaluator/body.md`, both
  `agent.yaml` (version bump), `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`, mirrors.
- **Rollback:** revert body edits + prompt lines; existing sessions' assumptions.md
  files become inert.
- **Stop-and-ask:** if the evaluator's prompt assembly has structurally changed from the
  anchors (no `LESSONS_TAIL`-style inlining found), stop — the inline pattern is the
  design, not an implementation detail.
- **Note (2026-07-07):** implemented this session — writer rules in both agent bodies
  (decomposer Rules bullet, evaluator step 5b), `ASSUMPTIONS_FILE` + `ASSUMPTIONS_TAIL`
  wired into both dispatch prompts (tail recomputed fresh at the evaluator site), both
  agent.yaml bumped to 1.3.0, mirrors resynced. Stop-and-ask checked: `LESSONS_TAIL`
  inlining intact at implementation time. Verify block green (sync ok, grep found
  ledger text in both rendered agents, `bash -n` ok, evals 79/79). Left IN-PROGRESS
  per G8 — a FRESH session must verify and flip to DONE.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line.
  (1) Ledger instructions present in both rendered agents — decomposer Rules bullet
  (`.claude/agents/goal-decomposer.md:207`, exact entry format + signal-only
  discipline), evaluator step 5b (`goal-evaluator.md:140-144`) plus the append-tooling
  note (`:38`). (2) Both dispatch prompts carry `$ASSUMPTIONS_FILE` as append target
  with an inlined `$ASSUMPTIONS_TAIL` (decomposer `run-goal.sh:1273/:1276`, evaluator
  `:1544/:1553`; tails built at `:1226`/`:1498`, the evaluator site recomputed fresh so
  same-iteration decomposer entries are visible; `ASSUMPTIONS_FILE` defined `:213`,
  before both uses). (3) Absent-ledger behavior functionally tested — the function
  extracted verbatim and run under `set -euo pipefail`: missing file → "(no assumptions
  recorded yet)", empty file → placeholder, populated file → tail; no crash on any
  path. (4) Verify block re-run verbatim green: sync wrote 0 (mirrors drift-free,
  working tree clean before/after), grep matched both rendered agents, `bash -n` ok,
  evals 79 pass / 0 fail. Both agent.yaml confirmed at 1.3.0; the NEED-5 commit
  carries neutral source + mirrors together (G2). Cross-check per the verification
  instructions: /goal-init CREATE round in a scratch repo (command/skill/template
  copied in; `validate_goal_file` extracted verbatim and red-green-tested first —
  three structurally bad files each fail with the matching specific error) produced a
  3-journey goal.md that passes `validate_goal_file` with zero template placeholders;
  `goal_lint.py` (itself red-tested: exit 2 `no-journeys` on a bad file) exits 0 on it.

### NEED-6 · Assumption ledger — surfacing
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** MED · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** a ledger nobody sees changes nothing. The human needs assumptions in the
  iteration summary and HTML report so they can veto early (by editing goal.md — the
  goal slice is rebuilt every iteration at `run-goal.sh:1221-1225`, so edits take effect
  next iteration).
- **Current state:** iteration-summarizer inputs are wired in `_run_iteration_summarizer`
  (`run-goal.sh:244-277`, with `eval_log_inline`-style tail injection ~`:231-232`).
  Summary template: `templates/iteration-summary.md`. The HTML renderer parses H2
  sections generically via `_split_h2_sections`
  (`scripts/automation/lib/render_iteration_summary.py:137-154`) and renders sections in
  `render_html_iteration` (~`:1160-1165`); it skips absent sections.
- **Change spec:**
  1. `templates/iteration-summary.md`: new `## Assumptions made` H2 (after
     `## Next step`).
  2. `agents/iteration-summarizer/body.md`: add the assumptions tail to its inputs and
     the new section to its output contract ("none recorded" when empty). Version-bump.
  3. `_run_iteration_summarizer` wrapper: inline the assumptions tail like the evaluator
     log tail.
  4. Renderer: `_render_assumptions(data)` + insertion in `render_html_iteration`
     (collapsed accordion, house style); extend the renderer's `self-test` with a
     summary containing the new section AND one without it.
- **DoD:** renderer self-test covers both cases; HTML shows the section when present,
  nothing when absent; artifact-schema validation (if it checks section lists) updated;
  evals green.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/lib/render_iteration_summary.py self-test &&
  ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `templates/iteration-summary.md`, `agents/iteration-summarizer/body.md` +
  `agent.yaml`, `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`,
  `scripts/automation/lib/render_iteration_summary.py`, mirrors.
- **Rollback:** revert; old summaries without the section keep rendering (renderer skips
  absent sections).
- **Stop-and-ask:** if `lib/artifact_schemas.py` hard-fails on unknown H2 sections
  (check before adding the template section), coordinate the schema change in the same
  commit or stop.
- **Depends on:** NEED-5.
- **Note (2026-07-07):** implemented this session. Stop-and-ask checked FIRST — code
  read (`artifact_schemas.py:193-196` checks required-H2 presence only) AND empirically
  validated (a summary with the new section passes `validate_path`), so no schema change
  needed; `Assumptions made` deliberately NOT added to `required_h2` (old summaries must
  keep validating). Template gains `## Assumptions made` after `## Next step` (one plain
  bullet per ledger entry — the ledger's own `## iter-N` headings must never be copied
  in, they'd fracture `_split_h2_sections`; "none recorded" when empty/phase mode).
  Summarizer body: inline-tail input + authoring section; agent.yaml 1.0.0→1.1.0.
  `_run_iteration_summarizer` inlines `_tail_or_placeholder "$ASSUMPTIONS_FILE" 200`
  exactly like the evaluator-log tail. Renderer: `_render_assumptions` (collapsed
  accordion, house style, bullets or plain "none recorded" text) inserted after
  What's-left+Next-step; self-test covers WITH (goal fixture, bullet asserted in HTML)
  and WITHOUT (phase fixture, accordion asserted absent). Verify block green: renderer
  self-test pass, `bash -n` ok, sync --check ok, evals 79/79. Left IN-PROGRESS per
  G8 — a FRESH session must verify and flip to DONE.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line.
  (1) Self-test coverage confirmed in the code, not just by exit status: the goal
  fixture carries the section (asserts exactly 1 extracted bullet, and both
  "Assumptions made" + the bullet's text in the rendered HTML); the phase fixture
  omits it (asserts "Assumptions made" absent from that HTML). Re-run fresh: pass,
  exit 0. (2) Present/absent behavior re-proven independently of the self-test
  fixtures — a synthetic summary run through `load_iteration` +
  `render_html_iteration` three ways: WITH section → accordion with the bullet;
  section stripped → no accordion at all; body `none recorded` → accordion renders
  it affirmatively. (3) Schema: `artifact_schemas.py:193-196` checks required-H2
  presence only (unknown sections cannot fail); iteration-summary `required_h2`
  (`:111-118`) deliberately excludes "Assumptions made" so old summaries keep
  validating; empirical `validate` CLI exit 0 on a section-carrying summary.
  (4) Verify block re-run verbatim green: self-test pass, evals 79 pass / 0 fail.
  Placement confirmed (template H2 order: … Next step, Assumptions made, Quick
  verify, Artifacts); `ASSUMPTIONS_FILE` defined `run-goal.sh:213` before its `:241`
  use; sync --check "would change 0" everywhere; agent.yaml at 1.1.0; commit 43159db
  carries neutral source + mirrors together (G2). Cross-check per the verification
  instructions: /goal-init drive in a scratch repo produced a 3-journey goal.md that
  passes `goal_lint.py` (exit 0) and `validate_goal_file` extracted verbatim from
  `run-goal.sh` (PASS; negative control: absent file rejected with the specific
  error, exit 1).

### NEED-9 · Goal-edit drift detection
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** MED · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-07)
- **Problem:** the user may edit `docs/goal.md` mid-session (that's the intended veto
  mechanism — the goal slice is rebuilt every iteration, `run-goal.sh:1221-1225`). But
  if the edited journey was already `passing`, `journey-history.json` keeps certifying
  it against the OLD text: a stale pass that can survive all the way into GOAL_ACHIEVED.
- **Current state:** journey state lives in `runs/goal-session-<sid>/state/
  journey-history.json` (rewritten by the evaluator each iteration); pre-eval snapshot
  + deterministic artifacts are built at `run-goal.sh:1460-1475`; the achievement gate
  (`scripts/automation/lib/goal-gates.sh:79-146`) requires every journey
  passing/already_passing. No journey-text hashing exists anywhere.
- **Change spec:**
  1. `lib/goal_gate.py`: new subcommand `hash-journeys <goal.md>` — stable hash (e.g.
     sha256 of normalized text) per `J-NN` block, JSON output. Reuse `_journey_blocks`.
  2. Pre-eval artifact build (`run-goal.sh:1460-1475`): compare current hashes against
     hashes recorded in journey-history (see step 4); for journeys whose recorded state
     is passing/already_passing but whose hash changed, write
     `iter-<N>/journeys-changed.md` listing them.
  3. `agents/goal-evaluator/body.md` (+ methodology skill if it enumerates inputs): read
     `journeys-changed.md` when present; listed journeys must be demoted to
     needs-reverify (not counted as passing) until re-verified against the NEW text;
     record new hashes when writing journey-history. Version-bump.
  4. Journey-history schema: entries gain a `spec_hash` field (writer: evaluator;
     tolerate absence for old sessions — treat missing hash as "unknown, no demotion").
  5. Achievement gate (`goal-gates.sh:79-146`): refuse GOAL_ACHIEVED when
     `journeys-changed.md` for the current iteration lists any journey not re-verified
     this iteration. Add an eval fixture (changed-hash → gate demotes).
- **DoD:** hash subcommand + self-test; changed-passing journey produces the note and
  the gate demotion in the fixture; old journey-history files (no `spec_hash`) still
  parse; evals green.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/lib/goal_gate.py self-test 2>/dev/null ||
  python3 scripts/automation/lib/goal_gate.py hash-journeys docs/goal.md &&
  bash -n scripts/automation/run-goal.sh && ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `scripts/automation/lib/goal_gate.py`,
  `scripts/automation/lib/goal-gates.sh`, `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`,
  `agents/goal-evaluator/body.md` + `agent.yaml`, `run-evals.sh` fixture, mirrors.
- **Rollback:** stop writing `journeys-changed.md` (one call site); the schema field is
  additive and tolerated-if-absent by design.
- **Stop-and-ask:** if journey-history.json is written anywhere other than the evaluator
  (grep first!), map every writer before adding the field — schema drift across writers
  is exactly the bug class G3 exists for.
- **Slices:** (a) hashing + change detection + pre-eval note; (b) evaluator body + gate
  wiring + fixture.
- **Note (2026-07-07):** slice (a) done, slice (b) pending. Writer census (stop-and-ask
  fired; user approved proceeding): the evaluator is the sole writer of journey ENTRIES;
  `run-goal.sh:760` only seeds the empty skeleton at session init;
  `render_iteration_summary.py:2563/2682/2860` are temp-dir self-test fixtures. Safe for
  slice (b) to add `spec_hash` with the evaluator as sole field writer. Interface built:
  `goal_gate.py hash-journeys <goal.md>` bare → flat `{"J-NN": sha256}` (what the
  evaluator should record); with `--history/--out-changed` run-goal.sh step 3c writes or
  removes `iter-<N>/journeys-changed.md` (self-tested). Slice (b) should also add a
  `runs/SCHEMA.md` entry for journeys-changed.md once it becomes an agent-consumed
  contract (deliberately not documented there yet — siblings like
  journey-history.pre.json aren't either). Known non-goal: a journey deleted from
  goal.md while recorded passing has no current hash → unknown, not flagged (orphan
  reconciliation stays evaluator/lint territory).
- **Note (2026-07-07, session 2):** slice (b) done — both slices now implemented; item
  stays IN-PROGRESS awaiting fresh-session verification (G8): re-run the Verify block,
  then flip to DONE + archive per §2.8. What landed: evaluator contract (body.md step 3)
  makes the evaluator record `spec_hash` per journey it verified this iteration (sole
  writer; carry-over journeys keep their old value or stay absent) and voids the prior
  pass of every journey listed in `iter-<N>/journeys-changed.md` — re-verify against the
  CURRENT text or demote to `unknown` ("needs-reverify" maps to `unknown`: additive, no
  new status value for readers to learn); methodology §A.1 bullet + evaluator dispatch
  prompt line added; agent.yaml 1.3.0→1.4.0; mirrors resynced. Gate: new
  `goal_gate.py drift <note> <history>` (parser lives beside the note's writer;
  round-tripped in the self-test; fail-closed exit 2 on unparsable note/unreadable
  history) wired as achievement-gate check 6 in `lib/goal-gates.sh` — a listed journey
  still passing without a re-recorded hash demotes GOAL_ACHIEVED. Fixtures (run inside
  run-evals.sh): changed-hash demotes / re-recorded hash certifies / absent note never
  blocks (gate self-test), plus drift unit cases incl. old-history tolerance (python
  self-test). `runs/SCHEMA.md` entry added per the session-1 note. Verified in-session:
  both self-tests red→green, Verify block ok, evals 79/79.
- **Verified (2026-07-07, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line.
  (1) Hash subcommand + self-test: `goal_gate.py self-test` fresh pass (exit 0);
  `hash-journeys` exercised bare on the repo's own `docs/goal.md` (→ `{}`, correct:
  the framework goal.md has no `J-NN` blocks) and on a real 3-journey file (three
  64-hex sha256 values); formatting-invariance (trailing whitespace, CRLF) asserted
  inside the self-test. (2) Fixture: `goal-gates.sh --self-test` 14/14 incl. the
  three drift cases — the note is built by the REAL writer from a stale-hash history
  (existence asserted), changed-hash journey demotes GOAL_ACHIEVED→CONTINUE with
  `FAIL drift` recorded in gate-report.md, re-recorded spec_hash certifies, note
  removed → stale hash alone never blocks. (3) Old-history tolerance asserted in the
  python self-test: entry without `spec_hash` never flagged, missing history file →
  no note, drift subcommand tolerates pre-NEED-9 histories, spec_hash-carrying
  history still parses in `cmd_journeys`. (4) Evals green twice — standalone and
  inside the verbatim Verify block — 79 pass / 0 fail each; `bash -n` ok. Wiring
  re-confirmed at the anchors: gate check 6 `goal-gates.sh:145-158`; note builder
  `run-goal.sh:1503-1510` + evaluator dispatch prompt line `:1556`; evaluator
  contract in `body.md` (input #14, `spec_hash` recording rules, GOAL_ACHIEVED drift
  veto) + methodology §A.1; `runs/SCHEMA.md:364` documents journeys-changed.md;
  agent.yaml at 1.4.0; sync --check "would change 0" everywhere; commits 0263ffa
  (slice a) + e0ebb55 (slice b) carry neutral source + mirrors together (G2).
  Cross-check per the verification instructions: /goal-init drive in a scratch repo
  produced a 3-journey goal.md that passes `goal_lint.py` (exit 0),
  `validate_goal_file` extracted verbatim from `run-goal.sh` (PASS), and
  `hash-journeys` (all three journeys hashed); negative controls: absent file and
  placeholder-only Anti-goals both rejected (exit 1, specific errors).

### NEED-7 · Intent checkpoint (opt-in resumable pause)
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** MED · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Implementer note (2026-07-08):** implemented per change spec — flags + gate ("1c.
  Intent checkpoint" in run-goal.sh, directly after the blueprint gate), deterministic
  `assemble_intent_review()`, resume-ack (reset tuple + sibling ack block touching
  `state/.intent-review-done`), docs (goal-status command + mirror, quickstart,
  interactive), and `tests/automation/test-intent-checkpoint.sh` (5 scenarios) wired
  into run-evals.sh 2c. The three blueprint-gate anchors were all intact (shifted
  ~20-40 lines). Verify block + full eval suite (80/80) green locally. Per G8 a FRESH
  session must re-run the Verify block and flip this to DONE — do not trust this note.
- **Problem:** goal mode runs hands-off from goal.md to GOAL_ACHIEVED. If the journeys
  encode the wrong product, the user finds out at the end. There is no mid-session
  "does this match what you wanted?" moment.
- **Current state:** the blueprint-approval gate is the proven resumable-pause pattern:
  pause block `run-goal.sh:1095-1147`, resume-status reset tuple `~:783`,
  resume-as-approval `~:800-804`. Flag parsing lives `~:104-121`; header status docs
  `~:46-52`. Journey counts are available deterministically via
  `python3 lib/goal_gate.py journeys` (`lib/goal_gate.py:68-86`); journey digest via
  `goal_gate.py digest`.
- **Change spec:**
  1. New flags: `--intent-checkpoint` (fire once when passing/total ≥ 50%) and
     `--intent-checkpoint-at N` (fire at iteration N). Both off by default.
  2. Gate at top-of-loop directly after the blueprint gate (`~:1147`), before ITER_DIR
     setup: if enabled, threshold met, and marker `state/.intent-review-done` absent —
     assemble `runs/goal-session-<sid>/intent-review.md` **deterministically** (no
     model): journey digest, assumptions.md tail (if NEED-5 shipped), project-story.md,
     links to `reports/goal-session-<sid>-index.html` + latest iteration summary HTML,
     and targeted questions (list of still-failing journeys + any `Reversible: no`
     assumptions). Write session status `AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW` (atomic python heredoc,
     same as blueprint gate), telemetry halt event, banner, exit 0.
  3. Resume (`--resume`): treat as acknowledgment — add `AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW` to the
     reset tuple and a sibling ack block that touches the marker. Fires once per session.
  4. Docs: `commands/goal-status.md` explains the new pause;
     `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md` + `docs/goal-mode-interactive.md` document the flags.
  5. New `tests/automation/test-intent-checkpoint.sh` modeled on
     `tests/automation/test-goal-checkpoints.sh` (sandbox repo + stub `claude` +
     fabricated `journey-history.json` at 50%): asserts fire-at-threshold, fire-once,
     resume-ack.
- **DoD:** sandbox session with `--intent-checkpoint-at 1` pauses after iter 1 with
  `intent-review.md` on disk and `status=AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW`; `--resume` proceeds
  and never fires again; test green; evals green.
- **Verify:** `bash -n scripts/automation/run-goal.sh &&
  bash tests/automation/test-intent-checkpoint.sh && ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `scripts/automation/run-goal.sh`, `commands/goal-status.md` + mirror,
  `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`, `docs/goal-mode-interactive.md`,
  `tests/automation/test-intent-checkpoint.sh` (new).
- **Rollback:** flags default-off ⇒ removing the gate block restores old behavior;
  the marker file is inert.
- **Stop-and-ask:** if the blueprint-gate code has been refactored away from the three
  anchors, stop and re-plan against whatever replaced it (the design is "clone the
  existing pause", not "invent a pause").
- **Verified (2026-07-08, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line, all four
  claims re-proven fresh. (1) Sandbox pause: `test-intent-checkpoint.sh` drives the
  REAL run-goal.sh in a sandbox repo with a stub `claude` — S5 asserts
  `--intent-checkpoint-at 1` pauses at iteration 1 with `intent-review.md` on disk,
  `status=AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW`, and zero agents dispatched; S1 proves the
  ≥50%-threshold variant plus the packet contents (still-failing journey named,
  `Reversible: no` assumption surfaced, ledger tail kept, project story, session-index
  + latest-iteration-summary links, telemetry halt event, marker untouched until
  resume). (2) Resume-ack + fire-once: S2 (marker touched, loop reached the
  decomposer, status left AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW) and S3 (marker present → never
  re-fires); S4 proves below-threshold no-fire. (3) Test green: 23/23 assertions.
  (4) Evals green: 80 pass / 0 fail, incl. the 2e mirror-drift check; `bash -n` ok —
  the full Verify block passed verbatim. Wiring re-confirmed at the anchors: flags
  `run-goal.sh:118-135`, paths `:241-242`, `assemble_intent_review()` `:683-748`,
  reset tuple `:935`, resume-ack `:961`, gate after the blueprint gate `:1314-1356`,
  header docs `:15-61`; eval wiring `run-evals.sh:139`; docs at
  `commands/goal-status.md:27` (mirror in sync), quickstart `:106,196-199`,
  interactive `:53,146`. No agent.yaml touched (pure shell/docs/test change, commit
  c663006 carries everything). Cross-check per the verification instructions:
  /goal-init drive in a scratch repo — a goal.md authored per
  templates/project-goal.md + skills/goal-authoring.md passes `goal_lint.py` (exit 0)
  and `validate_goal_file` extracted verbatim from run-goal.sh (PASS); negative
  controls: a sectionless file rejected by both (lint exit 2 `no-journeys`, validator
  exit 1 missing-section error).

### NEED-8 · Proposer enablement + vision-gap detection
- **Priority:** P0 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Implementer note (2026-07-08):** implemented per change spec — (1)
  `templates/proposer-guidance.md` with all six body-consumed sections (usefulness lens,
  read/MCP tools + pre-screen snapshot naming, validation screen,
  `enhancement-proposals.jsonl` schema, consistency, walkthrough) plus a fully-worked
  `expense-insights` example; (2) quickstart "Continuous improvement (opt-in)" section
  with the two-file opt-in and the no-op hook; (3) vision-gap step inserted as body
  Procedure step 2 (old 2–6 renumbered 3–7; result-file step notes gaps go in `summary`);
  agent.yaml 1.0.1→1.1.0. Activation anchor re-grepped: now `run-goal.sh:2044-2045`.
  No machine contract touched (nothing parses `enhancement-proposals.jsonl`;
  `proposer-result.json` is read for `extended` only). Verify block + full eval suite
  (80/80) green locally. Per G8 a FRESH session must re-run the Verify block and flip
  this to DONE — do not trust this note.
- **Problem:** the continuous-improvement agent (goal-proposer) is fully built but inert
  in every deployment: it only activates when BOTH `project-extensions/hooks/post-goal.sh`
  AND `project-extensions/proposer-guidance.md` exist (`run-goal.sh:1793-1794`), and no
  template for the guidance file ships. Separately, nothing checks that the Vision
  paragraph is actually covered by the journeys.
- **Current state:** `agents/goal-proposer/body.md:21-31` defines exactly what the
  guidance file must contain (usefulness lens, read/MCP tool list, validation-screen
  definition, `enhancement-proposals.jsonl` schema, consistency + walkthrough
  requirements); procedure steps at `:33-56`; honest-stop rule `:58-64`. Promotion is
  governed by `skills/goal-self-extension.md`.
- **Change spec:**
  1. New `templates/proposer-guidance.md` containing every section the body reads, with
     one fully-worked example project.
  2. `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`: new section "Continuous improvement (opt-in)" —
     the two-file opt-in incl. a minimal no-op hook (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` + `exit 0`).
  3. `agents/goal-proposer/body.md`: insert a vision-gap step between steps 1 and 2
     (~`:33-43`): parse goal.md Vision + Key Capabilities; list claims no journey
     (human or `<!-- AUTO:journeys -->`) covers; record each as a
     `robustness: speculative` candidate tagged `kind: vision-gap`; name uncovered
     claims in `proposer-result.json`'s summary. A gap alone must NOT force extension —
     the honest-stop rule still wins. Version-bump.
- **DoD:** template has every consumed section; quickstart shows the opt-in; rendered
  proposer mirror contains the vision-gap step; evals green.
- **Verify:** `grep -n "proposer-guidance" docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md
  templates/proposer-guidance.md && python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py
  --cli claude && grep -n "vision-gap" .claude/agents/goal-proposer.md &&
  ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `templates/proposer-guidance.md` (new), `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`,
  `agents/goal-proposer/body.md` + `agent.yaml`, mirrors.
- **Rollback:** delete template + revert body; feature stays opt-in-dormant either way.
- **Verified (2026-07-08, fresh session per G8):** DoD checked line by line, all four
  claims re-proven fresh. (1) Template completeness: `templates/proposer-guidance.md`
  carries all six sections the body reads by name — Usefulness lens, Read / MCP tools
  (with the pre-screen snapshot line, matching body input 6), Validation screen,
  Proposal format / `enhancement-proposals.jsonl` schema, Consistency requirement,
  Walkthrough requirement — plus the fully-worked `expense-insights` example.
  (2) Quickstart opt-in: "Continuous improvement (opt-in)"
  (`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md:260-281`) shows the two-file opt-in with the minimal
  no-op hook (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` + `exit 0`) and hook semantics (SESSION_ID /
  SESSION_DIR / REPO_ROOT / GOAL_FILE exported, bash-invoked, non-fatal) matching the
  dispatch code. (3) Rendered mirror: `.claude/agents/goal-proposer.md:48-51,73`
  carries the vision-gap step; `sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude` wrote 0 files (no
  drift). (4) Evals green: 80 pass / 0 fail, incl. the 2e mirror-drift check — the
  full Verify block passed verbatim end-to-end. Change-spec semantics re-read in the
  neutral body (`agents/goal-proposer/body.md:39-45,62-64`): vision-gap is Procedure
  step 2 (old 2–6 renumbered 3–7), candidates tagged `kind: vision-gap` +
  `robustness: speculative`, uncovered claims named in `proposer-result.json`
  `summary` (also when dry), and a gap alone never forces extension — the honest stop
  wins. agent.yaml at 1.1.0 (2026-07-08). Anchors re-confirmed: two-file activation
  condition `run-goal.sh:2044-2045`; `proposer-result.json` machine-read only at
  `:2082` for `extended`; grep over scripts/ + tests/ finds NO parser of
  `enhancement-proposals.jsonl` — no new machine contract, so no new eval fixture
  required (G3). Cross-check per the verification instructions: /goal-init drive in a
  scratch repo — a goal.md authored per templates/project-goal.md +
  skills/goal-authoring.md passes `goal_lint.py` (exit 0, clean) and
  `validate_goal_file` extracted verbatim from run-goal.sh (PASS, exit 0); negative
  control: the same file with its Anti-goals section stripped is rejected (exit 1,
  missing-section error).

### SAFE-1 · Pre-commit + CI eval guard
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Implementer note (2026-07-08, self-certified per Effort S):** implemented per change
  spec — (1) new `scripts/automation/install-git-hooks.sh`: opt-in installer for a
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` guard that derives the fast subset at COMMIT time by parsing
  the `_run_self_test` registrations in `run-evals.sh` (13 modules today, all pure
  python — no hardcoded list, so the subset cannot drift from the suite; zero
  registrations / missing `run-evals.sh` / missing python3 all fail LOUD and block).
  Measured 13/13 pass in ~0.5s (target <10s). Hook prints the full-suite command on
  every run and `--no-verify` bypass guidance on block. `--force` replaces a foreign
  pre-commit (backing it up to `pre-commit.bak`), `--uninstall` removes only our
  marker-carrying hook, `--self-test` runs a 17-assertion scratch-repo behavioral test
  (install/idempotence/green-commit/blocked-commit/restore/missing-suite/foreign-hook
  refusal/backup/uninstall) wired into `run-evals.sh` per maintenance-protocol §7.1.
  OPT-IN verified: grep shows no caller besides the run-evals self-test. (2) README:
  Utilities entries for `run-evals.sh` + the installer; new "Eval guard: pre-commit
  hook + CI branch protection" subsection under Tests with the exact GitHub branch
  protection click-path requiring the `offline eval suite` job (`harness-evals`
  workflow); Known-Limitations #4 reworded (evals DO run in Actions; pipeline stays
  CLI-only). DoD exercised live in THIS repo: installed, deliberately broke
  `scan_diff.py` (early `sys.exit(1)`), real `git commit` blocked (exit 1, module named,
  guidance printed, HEAD unchanged), restored byte-identical, hook green again.
  Empirical finding: `git commit --dry-run` does NOT invoke pre-commit hooks — the
  Verify block's dry-run wording is satisfied by the real blocked-commit exercise.
  Evals green after change: 82 pass / 0 fail. Rollback unchanged: delete
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (local-only) or `--uninstall`.
- **Problem:** nothing forces `run-evals.sh` to pass before a framework edit lands;
  a weaker model can commit red.
- **Current state:** `.github/workflows/evals.yml` runs the eval suite in CI, but
  branch protection / required-check status is not documented; no pre-commit hook.
- **Change spec:** (1) `scripts/automation/install-git-hooks.sh` installing a
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that runs a fast eval subset (the pure-python self-tests;
  target <10s) and prints how to run the full suite; opt-in (never auto-install).
  (2) README/docs note: enable branch protection requiring the evals workflow on `main`.
- **DoD:** hook installs and blocks a commit when a self-test is deliberately broken;
  docs updated.
- **Verify:** `bash scripts/automation/install-git-hooks.sh && git commit --dry-run`
  exercise with an intentionally broken fixture (then restore).
- **Files:** `scripts/automation/install-git-hooks.sh` (new), README or
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` note.
- **Rollback:** delete `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (local-only artifact).

### SAFE-2 · Agent-contract static linter
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Problem:** the top documented bug class is writer→reader drift: an agent body or
  template changes its verdict line / section format and the shell/python parsers stop
  matching — discovered mid-session instead of at edit time.
- **Current state:** `lib/verdicts.py` is the single source of verdict truth
  (`_VERDICT_LINE_RE` ~`:154`, per-report enums ~`:63-79`); `lib/artifact_schemas.py`
  validates artifacts at RUNTIME; `sync-cli-assets.py --check` covers mirror drift.
  Nothing statically checks the agent bodies/templates themselves.
- **Change spec:** new `scripts/automation/lib/lint_contracts.py` + eval registration:
  for every `agents/*/body.md`, assert it names its verdict values and they are a
  subset of the `verdicts.py` enum for that report type; for every
  `templates/*-verdict*.md` and report template, assert the `**Verdict:**` line matches
  `_VERDICT_LINE_RE`; assert every agent dir has `agent.yaml` with `model_tier` +
  `version`. Emit file:line for each violation. `self-test` with a deliberately broken
  fixture.
- **DoD:** linter green on current tree; deliberately breaking a template turns the eval
  red; wired into `run-evals.sh`.
- **Verify:** `python3 scripts/automation/lib/lint_contracts.py self-test &&
  ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `scripts/automation/lib/lint_contracts.py` (new), `run-evals.sh` (1 line).
- **Rollback:** remove the eval line.
- **Status note (2026-07-08, implementer session):** implemented + self-verified — TDD
  (self-test written first, watched RED, then GREEN: 12/12 broken-fixture violations,
  clean fixture 0); live break-probes on `templates/qa-report.md` and
  `agents/reviewer/body.md` both caught with file:line and restored; full eval suite
  green. Current tree lints CLEAN (the 9 shipped NEED items introduced no contract
  drift — nothing was "fixed to pass"). Left IN-PROGRESS per G8: a FRESH session must
  run the Verify block, then flip to DONE + archive per §2.8.
- **Verified (2026-07-08, fresh session per G8):** DoD re-proven line by line.
  (1) Linter green on current tree: `lint_contracts.py lint` exit 0 —
  "OK (19 agents, 22 templates)". (2) Break-probe: flipped `templates/qa-report.md`
  `**Verdict:** PASS` → `PASSED_MAYBE`; full `run-evals.sh` went RED (exit 1, the
  lint_contracts self-test named as the failure) and direct lint emitted both
  violations with file:line (`templates/qa-report.md:6 [unknown-verdict-value]`,
  `:1 [no-passing-verdict-line]`); restored, `git status` clean. (3) Wiring:
  `_run_self_test scripts/automation/lib/lint_contracts.py self-test` registered at
  `run-evals.sh:78`. Verify block re-run verbatim: clean fixture 0 violations, broken
  fixture 12/12 detected, current tree lint clean, eval suite 83 pass / 0 fail.
  Implementation matches the change spec, with one deliberate documented refinement:
  the `_VERDICT_LINE_RE` assertion applies to the templates parsed by
  `verdicts.check_verdict_file()` (`phase_verdict: True` — audit-report, qa-report,
  review-checklist); other verdict templates are checked for line-start markers with
  enum-valid values instead, which is the contract their parsers actually read.
  Adjacent same-class contract also spot-checked this session: /goal-init flow in a
  scratch repo produced a goal.md that passes the real `validate_goal_file`
  (negative-tested harness) and `goal_lint.py` with 0 findings.

### DOC-1 · Drift fixes in README/CLAUDE.md counts
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Problem:** README says "14 Claude agent definitions"; there are 19 `agents/*/` dirs.
  README "Agent Roles" table omits `goal-proposer` entirely. Skill count similarly
  stale ("13" vs 14).
- **Current state:** verified drift as of 2026-07-06.
- **Change spec:** recount from the filesystem (`ls -d agents/*/ | wc -l`, etc.); fix
  the numbers; add a goal-proposer row to the roles table (role text from
  `agents/goal-proposer/body.md` header); sweep for other count claims ("18 automation
  shell scripts", "18 report templates") and correct or de-number them ("~20+" is fine —
  prefer removing exact counts that will drift again).
- **DoD:** all count claims match the tree or are de-numbered; goal-proposer listed.
- **Verify:** `ls -d agents/*/ | wc -l` vs README claim; DOC-2's eval (if landed) green.
- **Files:** `README.md`, possibly `CLAUDE.md` (⚠ constitution — ask the user first,
  per protocol §1, and batch between sessions per §5).
- **Rollback:** docs-only.
- **Status note (2026-07-08, implementer session):** recounted fresh (the NEED cluster
  had added assets since the item was written): 19 `agents/*/`, 15 `skills/*.md`
  (item said 14), 24 `scripts/automation/*.sh`, 22 `templates/*.md`, 5 hooks.
  Chose DE-NUMBERING throughout (per spec preference): the five README "What This Is"
  inventory bullets now name the asset classes without counts; the agents bullet links
  to the Agent Roles table as the precise enumeration. Roles table: reality had
  drifted one step beyond the item text — BOTH `goal-proposer` AND `readme-maintainer`
  were missing; added both rows (tiers from their `agent.yaml`: strong/standard, role
  text from their `body.md` headers) since the DoD and DOC-2's future
  every-agent-in-table assertion require all 19. "11-step pipeline" kept — structural
  name, not an inventory count. CLAUDE.md (ask-first class): user approved de-numbering
  all three claims — "19 agents"→"Agents", "14 skills"(wrong, actual 15)→"Skills",
  "20 documented failure modes"→"Documented failure modes" (anti-patterns.md is
  append-only, guaranteed drift). Verified: every `agents/*/` dir name appears in the
  README roles table (scripted check); no numbered inventory claims remain in
  README/CLAUDE.md; `run-evals.sh` green (83 pass / 0 fail) before and after the
  CLAUDE.md batch. Effort S → self-verified per §2.7/G8 (fresh-session rule is M/L only).
  Consequence for DOC-2: no numbered README/CLAUDE.md claims remain, so its eval should
  focus on the roles-table completeness assertion (every `agents/*/` dir named) — the
  anchored-regex count checks will find nothing numbered to verify.

### DOC-2 · Doc-drift eval
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-08)
- **Problem:** counts drift back silently (they already did once).
- **Current state:** no doc checks in `run-evals.sh`.
- **Change spec:** `tests/automation/test-doc-drift.sh`: extract number claims from
  README/CLAUDE.md with anchored regexes ("N agents", "N skills"), compare to
  filesystem counts; assert every `agents/*/` dir name appears in the README roles
  table; register in `run-evals.sh`. If DOC-1 chose to de-number a claim, the check
  skips it (only verify what's numbered).
- **DoD:** eval green post-DOC-1; deliberately wrong count turns it red.
- **Verify:** `bash tests/automation/test-doc-drift.sh && ./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh`
- **Files:** `tests/automation/test-doc-drift.sh` (new), `run-evals.sh`.
- **Rollback:** remove eval line.
- **Depends on:** DOC-1.
- **Status note (2026-07-08, implementer session):** landed as a fixture-first eval
  (same layout as SAFE-2's `lint_contracts.py`: prove every check can go red on
  embedded fixtures, then check the live tree). Coverage: (a) anchored count-claim
  regexes for agents/skills/commands/hooks over README+CLAUDE.md vs neutral-source
  counts (`agents/*/`, `skills/*.md`, `commands/*.md`, `hooks/*.sh`) — all 8
  claim-family×file combinations currently skip, as DOC-1's de-numbering predicted;
  a re-numbered claim re-enters verification automatically (skip is presence-based,
  fixture-proven). (b) The kept "11-step pipeline" / "all 11 steps" structural claims
  ARE numbered, so they get a ground truth: run-phase.sh's own `log "Step X/N --`
  banners — anchored on the `log "`/` --` pair precisely because the bare pattern
  false-hits the "Step 4/5/6 retry blocks" comment (run-phase.sh:654); also asserts
  banner denominators agree and max integer step == denominator. (c) Roles table
  checked symmetrically — every `agents/*/` dir in the table (spec direction) AND no
  ghost rows naming deleted agents (drift is drift in both directions); set-compare
  via `comm`. Verified per DoD: live tree green (24/24); three planted README drifts
  (12-step claim, "99 specialized agents", deleted `demo-narrator` row) each
  individually caught, suite exit 1, then green again after revert. Registered in
  `run-evals.sh` §2c: suite went 83 → 84 pass / 0 fail, verbose line
  `PASS: unit: tests/automation/test-doc-drift.sh`. Effort S → self-verified per
  §2.7/G8 (fresh-session rule is M/L only).

### DOC-5 · "Reading the reports" guide
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** S · **Risk:** LOW · **Status:** absorbed into PLAIN-1 (§19) 2026-07-26
- **Problem:** the chain produces MD summaries, HTML reports, demo galleries, a session
  index, gate reports — nothing tells the owner which one to open and what to look for.
- **Current state:** partial coverage spread across README sections + `runs/SCHEMA.md`
  (machine-oriented).
- **Change spec:** `docs/READING-REPORTS.md`: per artifact — what it is, who it's for
  (owner vs maintainer), when it appears, the 3 things to check (e.g. session index:
  journey matrix trend, latest verdict, assumptions section once NEED-6 lands).
  One screenshot-free page; link from README "Outputs" table and the session-index
  footer if the renderer has one.
- **DoD:** every report artifact in `runs/SCHEMA.md`'s human-facing set has an entry.
- **Verify:** cross-check list vs `runs/SCHEMA.md`; link greps.
- **Files:** `docs/READING-REPORTS.md` (new), README.
- **Rollback:** docs-only.
- **Absorption note (2026-07-26):** delivered as PLAIN-1 slice 1 — the guide gained a
  status/verdict glossary and a code legend, and the renderer footer link became part
  of PLAIN-1 slice 4 (renderer commit).

### PLAIN-1 · Plain-English explanation layer (absorbs DOC-5)
- **Priority:** P1 · **Effort:** M · **Risk:** MED · **Status:** DONE (2026-07-26)
- **Verified (2026-07-26, fresh non-implementer session per G8, at 138982c):** DoD
  checked line by line. Verify block re-run green: evals 136 pass / 0 fail
  (`test-plain-language.sh` in the §2c list; 59 pass / 0 fail standalone),
  `sync-cli-assets.py --check` 0 drift, renderer self-test passed (updated pins + the
  MD-contract assertions), lib smoke prints the three-part plain block ending in the
  `docs/READING-REPORTS.md` pointer. Call-sites: 22 `explain_goal_status`/`_verdict`
  sites in run-goal.sh (every anchored halt — BUDGET_EXHAUSTED, STALLED ×2,
  REGRESSION_HALT, ABORT_MALFORMED — all pauses, GOAL_ACHIEVED, the verdict line
  `:2246`) + 5 `explain_phase` sites in run-phase.sh (Review/QA pass+fail, final
  banner). Glossary: all 12 statuses + 5 verdicts appear in READING-REPORTS.md, which
  is linked from README and the quickstart top. Writer wiring: iteration-summarizer /
  demo-narrator / readme-maintainer name the skill (agent.yaml bumps 2.0.0→2.1.0,
  1.1.0→1.2.0, 1.0.0→1.1.0), retro-analyst carries the rules inline by design (no
  skill line), goal-status translates with the raw code in parentheses. Evaluator:
  §6b at body.md:201, agent.yaml 1.8.0; spot-run evidenced by the kept
  `judgment-goal-evaluator-*` sandboxes (shared temp root): both bracketing cases ran
  WITH the §6b body (v1.8.0 confirmed inside each sandbox), GOT == EXPECTED
  (GOAL_ACHIEVED / REGRESSION), prose follows the new rule, `**Verdict:**` markers
  byte-exact — in fact the full 6-case goal-evaluator suite was green (the a87a59f
  14/14 re-baseline run carried the §6b working tree). Architecture skill-count
  claims read 16 in all three docs plus the skills-and-hooks row.
- **Problem:** every surface the owner actually reads is written for the machine or for
  maintainer AIs: ~20 SHOUTING status/verdict codes with no gloss at point of use
  (STALLED vs AWAITING_PUMP vs REGRESSION_HALT vs ABORT_MALFORMED all mean "stopped"
  with different remedies), roadmap codenames leaking into terminal output and retros
  (REL-14, EVO-1, §16), 35–50-word sentences with env-vars inline, five unlegended
  severity scales (P0-2 / S-M-L / LOW-MED-HIGH / CRITICAL-IMPORTANT-GAP-OBSERVATION /
  anti-goal critical-minor). The friendly layer that exists (`## In plain words`, HTML
  story pages, pause banners) reaches only 2 of 20 agents, and nothing tells the owner
  which file to open.
- **Current state:** (anchors @ 4181629) run-goal.sh: 253 ad-hoc echo sites, no style
  policy, halt lines are bare codes (`:1458` BUDGET_EXHAUSTED, `:1465`/`:2448` STALLED,
  `:2442` REGRESSION_HALT, `:2458` ABORT_MALFORMED); only the pause banners
  (`:1511-1532`, `:1581-1596`) are owner-readable. The ONLY enum→sentence translation
  in the repo is `skills/goal-interactive-dispatch.md:242-254` (pump-only).
  goal-evaluator body: zero style guidance; `## Next-Step Recommendation` mandates
  ID-speak. Renderer prints raw enums in hero/cover/pills
  (`render_iteration_summary.py:1355`, `:1875`, `:1326-1334`) though a plain-word pill
  map already exists (`:1586-1592`). Style guidance overall: 2 UI-scoped skills + one
  core.md line — no shared standard, no glossary doc.
- **Change spec:** six commits, each independently eval-green:
  1. this roadmap entry (+ DOC-5 absorbed → archive).
  2. `docs/READING-REPORTS.md` (new; DOC-5's guide + status/verdict glossary + code
     legend), linked from README outputs area + `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md` top.
  3. NEW `scripts/automation/lib/plain-language.sh` (`explain_goal_status STATUS [SID]
     [ROOT]`, `explain_goal_verdict VERDICT DEPTH`, `explain_phase KEY`, `plain_*_keys`
     list fns; case-based; every fn `return 0`) + additive call-sites at every
     run-goal.sh halt/pause/verdict echo and run-phase.sh Review/QA/final-banner lines
     (existing echoes byte-untouched; `run-goal.sh:1793` is test-pinned) + NEW
     `tests/automation/test-plain-language.sh` (map completeness; coverage of every
     `write_session_summary "X"` / `d["status"] = "X"` status; output purity — no
     `**Verdict:**`/`## `/parse-marker strings; pinned-literal re-asserts) wired into
     the `run-evals.sh` §2c list.
  4. renderer: `_PLAIN_BADGE` map + `badge-enum` suffix at hero/cover, plain pill text
     with raw status in `title=`, session-index footer link to READING-REPORTS.md;
     update the 4 affected self-test expect-list pins in the same commit
     (`"J-04 · passing"` → `"J-04 · ✓ working"` etc.); the `:2402-2438` MD-contract
     assertions must pass UNCHANGED.
  5. NEW `skills/plain-language.md` (audience profile, hard rules, plain-word table
     copied from the lib, 3 bad→good pairs, never-simplify list) wired via one
     "always read" line into iteration-summarizer, demo-narrator, readme-maintainer.
     retro-analyst gets NO skill line (light tier + its one-file evidence boundary):
     instead its body inlines the literal rules — a code-legend line in the report
     skeleton, "first Problem sentence is plain English", no bare codenames.
     `commands/goal-status.md` gains "translate the
     status, raw code in parentheses"; bump each touched agent.yaml version; fix the
     eval-enforced "15 skills" claims → 16 (architecture README/adoption-guide/
     system-overview) + skills-and-hooks row; resync mirrors.
  6. goal-evaluator: ONE additive block `### 6b. Plain-language rule for prose fields`
     (scope: Reasoning / Next-step recommendation / `## Summary` /
     `## Next-Step Recommendation` / `## Halt Justification` ONLY; short sentences;
     journey IDs always carry their short name; describe what the user would see; the
     block must NOT contain a literal verdict-marker string, lint_contracts
     `:169-199`); agent.yaml 1.7.0 → 1.8.0; resync; then the judgment spot-run below
     BEFORE push.
- **Spot-run gate (commit 6):** `run-judgment-evals.sh --list --judge goal-evaluator`
  first (free); STOP if 2 × per-case estimate > ~US$5. Then exactly two bracketing
  cases with `--keep-sandbox`: `case-01-clean-goal-achieved` and
  `case-03-regression-broken-journey` (≈ $4.76 projected). Both must exit 0 with
  GOT == EXPECTED; eyeball sandbox eval.md for the new style. Any class flip →
  `git revert` commit 6 + resync, stop.
- **DoD:** every terminal halt/pause and the per-iteration verdict line print a plain
  what-happened / is-the-product-OK / what-to-do block + a `docs/READING-REPORTS.md`
  pointer; every status in READING-REPORTS.md glossary; renderer hero/cover/pills show
  plain words (enum still visible); the 4 writer agents name the skill; evaluator
  prose rule landed with spot-run green; evals green; machine contracts byte-identical
  (self-test (c) proves it).
- **Verify:** `./scripts/automation/run-evals.sh` after every commit;
  `python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude --check`;
  `bash -c 'source scripts/automation/lib/plain-language.sh; explain_goal_status
  STALLED demo /tmp'`; renderer self-test; the spot-run.
- **Files:** `docs/improvement-roadmap.md`, `docs/READING-REPORTS.md` (new), README,
  `docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`, `scripts/automation/lib/plain-language.sh` (new),
  `scripts/automation/{run-goal.sh,run-phase.sh,run-evals.sh}`,
  `tests/automation/test-plain-language.sh` (new),
  `scripts/automation/lib/render_iteration_summary.py`, `skills/plain-language.md`
  (new), `agents/{iteration-summarizer,retro-analyst,demo-narrator,readme-maintainer,
  goal-evaluator}/{body.md,agent.yaml}`, `commands/goal-status.md`,
  `.claude/architecture/{README,adoption-guide,system-overview,skills-and-hooks}.md`,
  regenerated mirrors.
- **Rollback:** per-commit `git revert` (each slice is independent); commit 6 revert
  must be followed by a resync.
- **Stop-and-ask:** spot-run projected cost > ~US$5; any golden verdict class flip;
  any place where a plain line cannot be ADDED without editing a test-pinned or
  machine-parsed line.
- **Non-goals:** diagnostic/tripwire console lines; enum/schema/path renames; length
  budgets on specs (D6); reviewer/auditor bodies; roadmap/commit-message prose; a
  中文 layer (possible later on top of the same single-source table).
