# Goal Mode Telemetry Schema

Goal-mode runs write structured telemetry to `runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl`. Each line is a single JSON object describing one event. The file is append-only across the lifetime of a session (and across `--resume` calls).

This file documents the event schema. The data stays local: nothing is transmitted from the project. A future plan may add an opt-in sanitized export to feed framework self-evolution, but this plan only captures the data.

## Common fields

Every event includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (e.g., `2026-05-04T12:34:56Z`) |
| `session_id` | string | The goal session id (matches `runs/goal-session-<sid>/`) |
| `iter` | number \| null | Current iteration index (0 = baseline). `null` for session-level events. |
| `event` | string | Event type — one of the values listed below |

Event-specific fields are merged at the top level of the JSON object.

## Event types

### `session_start`
Written by `run-goal.sh` when a session starts (or resumes).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | string | `new` or `resume` |
| `max_iterations` | number | Configured cap (`0` = unlimited / no cap, the default) |
| `stall_window` | number | Configured stall window |
| `auto_release` | boolean | Whether `--auto-release` was passed |

### `session_end`
Written when the loop halts.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `final_verdict` | string | `GOAL_ACHIEVED` \| `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` \| `STALLED` \| `REGRESSION_HALT` \| `ABORTED` |
| `total_iterations` | number | Iterations completed (excluding the final halt detection) |
| `wall_time_seconds` | number | Total elapsed wall time |
| `quota_pause_count` | number | Number of times `claude_with_quota_retry` slept for quota |

### `iter_start`
Written before goal-decomposer is invoked for an iteration.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `iter_name` | string | The synthetic phase name (`goal-<sid>-iter-<N>`) |
| `prior_verdict` | string \| null | Verdict from previous iteration (null on iter 0) |
| `prior_depth` | string \| null | Depth used in previous iteration |

### `decomposer_start`, `decomposer_end`
Wrap the goal-decomposer agent invocation.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Always `goal-decomposer` |
| `mode` | string | `--baseline` or `--next` |
| `exit_status` | number | (end only) Process exit code |
| `duration_seconds` | number | (end only) Wall time |
| `retries` | number | (end only) Quota-retry count for this invocation |

### `iter_dispatch`
Records which pipeline was chosen for this iteration.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `depth` | string | `lean` or `full` |
| `target_journeys` | array of strings | Journey IDs this iteration targets (e.g., `["J-01","J-03"]`) |
| `maintenance_isolation` | string | The RAW `${CHAIN_MAINTENANCE_ISOLATION:-false}` literal as it stands after `apply_maintenance_isolation_from_spec` has materialized any `Maintenance isolation: required` spec line — `"true"` when the spec declared it, `"false"` when unset, but any operator-set truthy value (`"1"`, `"yes"`, `"on"`, `"required"`, `"TRUE"`) is emitted verbatim, so consume it with the same truthy set the engine uses rather than `== "true"`. A string on both the jq and the jq-less path, never a boolean. The only per-iteration record that the app/browser lanes were withheld by contract |

### `agent_invocation_start`, `agent_invocation_end`
Wrap each agent call inside an iteration (developer, reviewer, browser-qa-agent, etc.).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Agent name |
| `exit_status` | number | (end only) Process exit code |
| `duration_seconds` | number | (end only) Wall time, INCLUDING any quota-pause sleep |
| `quota_sleep_seconds` | number | (end only) Seconds of that wall time spent in quota-pause sleeps (SPEED-13) |
| `active_seconds` | number | (end only) `duration_seconds − quota_sleep_seconds` — the honest work time (SPEED-13) |
| `retries` | number | (end only) Quota-retry count for this invocation |

### `quota_pause_start`, `quota_pause_end`
Recorded around quota-exhaustion sleeps inside `claude_with_quota_retry`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Agent that triggered the pause |
| `reset_epoch` | number | (start only) Epoch the sleep targets |
| `sleep_seconds` | number | (end only) Total seconds slept |

> Note: These events are emitted directly by `lib/quota-retry.sh` at its sleep
> sites (both claude and codex paths; SPEED-13). They no-op outside goal mode —
> `record_telemetry_event` is disabled when no goal session is active. The same
> path increments the session's `.quota-pause-count` file.

### `evaluator_start`, `evaluator_end`
Wrap the goal-evaluator agent invocation.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Always `goal-evaluator` |
| `exit_status` | number | (end only) Process exit code |
| `duration_seconds` | number | (end only) Wall time |
| `retries` | number | (end only) Quota-retry count |

### `iter_end`
Written after the evaluator returns and state is updated.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `iter_name` | string | The synthetic phase name |
| `verdict` | string | The evaluator's verdict |
| `next_depth` | string | The evaluator's next-iteration depth recommendation |
| `journey_deltas` | object | Counts: `{newly_passing, newly_failing, regressed, anti_goal_violations}` |

### `halt`
Written when a hard halt fires before normal `iter_end`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `reason` | string | Includes `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `STALLED`, `REGRESSION_HALT`, `ABORT_MALFORMED`, `DECOMPOSER_FAILED`, `GATE_BLOCKED_POST_DECOMPOSE`, `machine_reset`, and the resumable pauses `AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL`, `AWAITING_INTENT_REVIEW`, `AWAITING_PUMP`, `AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH`, `AWAITING_DISK`, `AWAITING_HOST_GUARD`, `AWAITING_FULL_DEPTH`. `ABORTED` is a session *status* only — the SIGINT trap writes the summary, not a halt event. Not a closed enum: `grep -n 'record_telemetry_event "halt"' scripts/automation/run-goal.sh` is the ground truth |
| `detected_at_step` | string | Where the halt was detected (e.g., `pre_decomposer`, `post_evaluator`; `AWAITING_FULL_DEPTH` uses `depth-arbiter`, `depth-parse`, `full-dispatch`, `depth-legacy-allowlist` or `isolation-requires-full` — the five sites that could otherwise have silently run at less than the required depth) |
| `demotion_reason` | string | `AWAITING_FULL_DEPTH` only: why full depth could not be dispatched — `arbiter-demotion:<rung>`, `unparseable Depth line in <spec-path>`, `run-phase.sh lacks --no-finalize`, `legacy-allowlist:no-qualifying-trigger (…)`, or `maintenance isolation requires full depth but this spec resolved to <depth>`. Mirrors the `reason=` field of `iter-<N>/depth-requirement-unmet`, which also carries a `remedy=` line naming the one action that unblocks that specific step |

### `iter_push` (opt-in)
Written by `run-goal.sh` after each iteration when `--push-per-iter` is enabled. One event per iteration. Captures whether the per-iter commit + push succeeded and which branch received the commit.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `branch` | string | The push branch name (e.g., `goal/my-app`) |
| `commit_sha` | string | SHA of the commit created (empty on commit/add failure) |
| `success` | boolean | True if commit + push both succeeded, OR the iteration was deliberately skipped (no changes / halt verdict) |
| `error` | string | Failure reason: `"add failed"`, `"commit failed"`, `"push failed"`. Empty on success. |
| `skipped` | string | When success is true but no commit was made: `"no_changes"` (clean working tree) or `"halt_verdict"` (REGRESSION / STALLED). Absent on actual commits. |
| `verdict` | string | The iteration verdict that triggered the eligibility check |

To enable: pass `--push-per-iter` (and optionally `--push-branch <name>`) to `run-goal.sh`. See [goal-mode-quickstart.md](goal-mode-quickstart.md) for the full flow.

### `claude_usage` (default-on headless; best-effort interactive)
Written by `claude_with_quota_retry` after a successful Claude invocation when `CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS=true` — which is the **default** for the headless backend (`lib/quota-retry.sh`). Captures Claude API usage from the stream-json `result` event via `lib/claude_stream_renderer.py`. Set `CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS=false` to opt out. **Interactive-pump path (protocol v2, TOKEN-5):** the pump extracts each dispatch's token totals from its own Claude Code session transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, per-message usage summed — the recipe lives in `skills/goal-interactive-dispatch.md`) and writes them to the request's `usage_path` sidecar; `lib/interactive-dispatch.sh` validates it and emits the same event through the same telemetry helper. Best-effort: a pre-v2 pump, a failed extraction, or a malformed sidecar (skipped with one warning) records no event for that dispatch — absence means "unknown", never estimated. Interactive events omit `total_cost_usd` (no per-call USD price on the interactive plan; the analyzer's cost column reads 0 for them).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | The agent context that drove the call (set by `record_agent_invocation_start`) |
| `usage.input_tokens` | number | Non-cached input tokens |
| `usage.output_tokens` | number | Output tokens generated |
| `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` | number | Input tokens served from prompt cache |
| `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` | number | Input tokens written to prompt cache |
| `total_cost_usd` | number | Total cost reported by the API for this invocation |
| `duration_ms` | number | Wall-clock duration of the claude call |
| `duration_api_ms` | number | API-side duration |
| `num_turns` | number | Number of model turns (assistant/tool_use cycles) |
| `is_error` | boolean | True if the result event was an error |
| `subtype` | string | `success` \| `error_max_turns` \| etc. |
| `output_style` | string \| null | The **effective** Claude Code output style, read from the stream-json `system/init` event by `lib/claude_stream_renderer.py` and carried in through the usage sidecar. `default` when no style is active; null on CLIs that do not report it (older `claude`, Codex) — null means *unknown*, never "default" |
| `available_output_styles` | string \| null | Comma-joined list of the output styles Claude Code reports as available, read from the same stream-json `system/init` event by `lib/claude_stream_renderer.py` (`:189-190`) and carried in through the usage sidecar. null when the CLI does not report the field — observed on CLI 2.1.237 |
| `output_style_requested` | string | The style the engine **requested** for this dispatch (STYLE-1; e.g. `Concise`). Absent when no style was requested. Interactive-backend rows read `<name>(emulated)` — subagents never receive a style natively, so the seam appends the emulation block to the prompt instead. Compare against `output_style` to know whether the arm actually ran. The trace row (`trace/trace.jsonl`) carries the same `output_style_requested` key next to its effective `output_style`. |

Enabled by default headless; opt out with `export CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS=false`. To opt out of cache hygiene (`--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`): `export CHAIN_CLAUDE_DISABLE_CACHE_HYGIENE=true`.

Aggregate per-session and per-agent with:
```bash
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl
```

### Timing / experiment events

| Event | Written by | Payload highlights |
|---|---|---|
| `step_skipped` | `goal-iter-lean.sh`, `run-goal.sh`, `run-phase.sh` | `{step, iter_name|phase, reason}` — a step was skipped instead of dispatched. Reasons: `checkpoint` (resume reused a completed step), `zero-change` (SPEED-14), `iter-budget-trim` (SPEED-15 rungs 3a/3b: `test-plan`/`ux-regression`, payload key `phase`), `ui-combined` (SPEED-24: `ui-test-design` folded into the ui-impact dispatch, payload key `phase`) |
| `dispatch_wait` | `lib/interactive-dispatch.sh` | `{agent, wait_seconds, run_seconds, status, rc}` — pickup-wait vs run split per interactive dispatch attempt (`ok` \| `pickup-timeout` \| `inflight-timeout` \| `inflight-timeout-requeued`) |
| `review_verdict` | `lib/telemetry.sh` `record_review_verdict` (called by `goal-iter-lean.sh` at both review attempts and by `run-phase.sh` Step 3 in full-depth iterations; the Step 7/9 hardening reviews of phase mode emit nothing) | `{verdict, attempt, iter_name}` — reviewer outcome per attempt (feeds the tripwire). `verdict` is `PASS` \| `PASS_WITH_NOTES` \| `FAIL`, or `""` when the dispatched reviewer returned without a parseable `**Verdict:**` line (quota pauses and resume-skipped reviews emit no event) |
| `iter_config` | `run-goal.sh` | `{key, value}` — an opt-in experiment knob was active this iteration. One event per active knob: `CHAIN_AGENT_EFFORT` carries the effort map; `CHAIN_OUTPUT_STYLES` (STYLE-1) carries the whole arm string (`CHAIN_OUTPUT_STYLES=… CHAIN_AGENT_OUTPUT_STYLE=… CHAIN_OUTPUT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=…`, sanitized). Any `iter_config` event marks the iteration knob-active for the tripwire window |
| `golden_coverage` | `goal-iter-lean.sh`, `browser-qa-phase.sh` (goal iterations) | `{passing, missing_goldens, iter_name}` — PASSing journeys still lacking a replay golden (also persisted to `state/golden-gaps`, SPEED-23) |
| `experiment_reverted` | `run-goal.sh` | `{key, value}` — the tripwire auto-reverted an experiment knob |
| `spec_regenerated` | `run-goal.sh` | `{iter_name, dropped}` — a resume re-ran the goal-decomposer over an existing spec that carried an operator-only line (`Maintenance isolation: required` / `Depth enforcement: required`), which regeneration destroys because the decomposer is forbidden to write them (anti-pattern 25). Paired with a loud `WARNING: regenerating … will DROP operator-only line(s)` on stderr. `dropped` names the operative line found; the probe uses the predicates, so when both are present the isolation one is named |
| `depth_full_granted` / `depth_demoted` | `run-goal.sh` | `{reason, prior_verdict, prior_depth}` — the SPEED-20 deterministic depth arbiter granted a spec-requested full (`prior-verdict-*`, `prior-coherence-fail`, `cadence-due`, `new-fullstack-journey`) or demoted it to lean (`budget-breach`, `full-cap`, `evaluator-requested-*`, legacy `no-full-trigger`) |
| `depth_cost_overridden` | `run-goal.sh` | `{requirement:"hard-full-required", overridden_cost_rung, prior_verdict, prior_depth}` — the iteration was hard-required full (`CHAIN_REQUIRE_FULL_DEPTH` or a `Depth enforcement: required` spec line) and the precedence rung overrode a COST rung that would otherwise have demoted it: `budget-breach`, `full-cap`, or `evaluator-requested-lean`/`evaluator-requested-evidence`. Evidence only — the overridden rung's on-disk marker (e.g. the previous iteration's `budget-breached`) is deliberately left untouched. Without jq the payload carries `requirement` + `overridden_cost_rung` only |
| `maintenance_isolation_refused` | `lib/common.sh` `maintenance_isolation_refuse` (called from `_boot_shared_services`, `ensure_services_running`, `browser-qa-phase.sh`, `replay_lane_partition_and_verify`, `demo-phase.sh` and `run-goal.sh`'s showcase-join) | `{operation, detail}` — a path forbidden under maintenance isolation was reached and REFUSED rather than degraded. `operation` is the refusing site (`ensure_services_running`, `_boot_shared_services`, `browser-qa-phase`, `replay_lane_partition_and_verify`, `demo-phase`, `demo_runner`, `demo golden auto-derive`, `async-showcase-join`). The same call appends a tab-separated `<utc-timestamp>\toperation=…\tdetail=…` line to `runs/goal-session-<sid>/iter-<N>/maintenance-isolation-refusals`, so the refusal survives even where telemetry is unavailable |
| `iter_budget` | `lib/common.sh` (any budget-aware script) | `{budget, elapsed, mode, at_step}` — first over-budget check of the process (SPEED-15; defaults 3600s/trim) |
| `iter_budget_trim` | `run-goal.sh`, `goal-iter-lean.sh`, `run-phase.sh`, `browser-qa-phase.sh` | `{rung}` — a trim rung actually shed work (`showcase-defer`, `replay-narrow`, `testplan-skip`, `ux-regression-skip`) |
| `goal_slice_fallback` | `lib/common.sh` (executor dispatch sites) | `{iter_name, rc}` — the TOKEN-10 executor goal-slice build failed; the dispatch fell back loudly to the full `docs/goal.md` |
| `golden_autoderived` / `golden_autoderive_rejected` | `lib/replay-lane.sh` (via `demo-phase.sh`) | `{journey, iter_name}` — a SPEED-21 demo-derived golden candidate replayed green and was installed, or failed its verify pass and was discarded |
| `golden_nudge` | `goal-iter-lean.sh`, `browser-qa-phase.sh` | `{journey, iter_name}` — SPEED-23 promoted this journey's golden to a REQUIRED deliverable this dispatch |
| `replay_mass_fail_voided` / `replay_mass_fail_confirmed` | `lib/replay-lane.sh` / `goal-iter-lean.sh` | `{iter_name, journeys, canaries}` — SPEED-22 mass-false-FAIL breaker outcome: green canaries voided the replay FAILs (drift), or a canary failure kept the full re-confirm path |

### `missing_evidence` (REL-11 tripwire)
Written when a dispatch returns — any exit code, including 0 — without its expected report artifact on disk: full-mode QA (`qa-phase.sh`), the lean browser-qa LLM lane (`goal-iter-lean.sh`; quota pauses excluded), the retro-analyst (`run-goal.sh`), the developer's dev handoff (`goal-iter-lean.sh` lean, `dev-phase.sh` full), the ui-impact-analyst's user-visible-changes report (`ui-impact-phase.sh`, alongside the SKIPPED stub), and the ux-regression review (`ux-regression-phase.sh`). The telemetry counterpart of the loud `[missing-evidence]` stderr banner (`lib/common.sh` `warn_missing_evidence`). Non-blocking — a tripwire, never a gate.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Dispatching agent whose report is missing (`qa` \| `browser-qa-agent` \| `retro-analyst` \| `developer` \| `ui-impact-analyst` \| `ux-regression-reviewer`) |
| `path` | string | The expected report path that was absent |

### `output_style_mismatch` (STYLE-1)
Written when the output style the engine requested for a dispatch is **not** the one that actually ran. The headless seam (`lib/quota-retry.sh`) compares the requested name against the effective `output_style` from the stream-json `init` event after each invocation — the CLI ignores an unknown or unapplied `--settings` style silently, so this readback is the only ground truth. The interactive seam (`lib/interactive-dispatch.sh`) writes it when a valid style has no emulation text and the dispatch therefore went out unstyled. Non-blocking — the work already happened — but **any occurrence invalidates that dispatch's membership in the arm**: exclude it before comparing styled vs unstyled numbers.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | The agent context of the dispatch |
| `requested` | string | The style the engine asked for (empty = none) |
| `effective` | string | The style that actually ran (`default` when none; empty on the interactive backend, where there is nothing to read back) |
| `backend` | string | `headless` \| `interactive` |
| `reason` | string | Interactive only: `no-emulation-text` |

### Wall-time report and tripwire

Where do the ~2 hours of an iteration go? Per-iteration wall breakdown (per-agent
minutes, resume-skips, pump wait, parallel-overlap savings, unattributed glue):

```bash
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py --wall runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py --wall --iter 4 ...   # one iteration
```

`run-goal.sh` prints this automatically after every `iter_end` and embeds the
full report in `runs/goal-session-<sid>/summary.md`; the per-iteration HTML page
carries it as a "Timing" accordion.

The experiment tripwire (exit 3 = TRIP) judges the last `--window` knob-active
iterations; `run-goal.sh` runs it each iteration while `CHAIN_AGENT_EFFORT` or
any `CHAIN_OUTPUT_STYLE*` knob is set, and auto-reverts every active knob on
TRIP (one `experiment_reverted` event per key):

- **Quality dimension** — any `REGRESSION` verdict, any journey regression, an
  unparseable review verdict, or first-attempt review `FAIL`s in ≥2 iterations of
  the window. "Unparseable" is a `review_verdict` event with an empty `verdict`:
  `goal-iter-lean.sh` (and `run-phase.sh` Step 3 in full-depth iterations, via
  the same helper) writes one when the reviewer was dispatched and came back
  without a parseable `**Verdict:**` line (quota pauses excluded, and a
  resume-skipped review emits no event at all).
- **Cost dimension** (ground rule D5: an earlier "be terser" change *increased*
  turns and roughly doubled output tokens) — per agent, the median of
  `usage.output_tokens` and of `num_turns` over the styled `claude_usage` rows
  in the window (`output_style_requested` set) against the same agent's unstyled
  rows in the session. TRIPs above **1.5×**, and only with **≥3 rows on each
  side**. Reasons are prefixed `cost:`.

```bash
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py --tripwire --window 3 runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl
```

## Reading the telemetry

```bash
# All events for a session
jq -c '.' runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl

# Total quota pause time
jq -s '[.[] | select(.event=="quota_pause_end") | .sleep_seconds] | add' \
  runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl

# Per-agent latency summary
jq -s '
  group_by(.agent)
  | map({
      agent: .[0].agent,
      invocations: length,
      total_seconds: ([.[] | .duration_seconds // 0] | add),
      avg_seconds: ([.[] | .duration_seconds // 0] | add / length)
    })
' < <(jq -c 'select(.event=="agent_invocation_end")' runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl)

# Iteration-by-iteration verdicts
jq -c 'select(.event=="iter_end") | {iter, verdict, next_depth}' \
  runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl

# Per-agent token usage and cost (requires CHAIN_TELEMETRY_TOKENS=true during run)
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl

# Or as JSON for downstream tooling
python3 scripts/automation/lib/analyze_telemetry.py --json runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl
```

## Stability

The schema is additive: new event types and new fields may be introduced in future versions. Consumers should ignore unknown event types and unknown fields.

The `event` field values listed above are stable — they will not be renamed or removed without a deprecation cycle.
