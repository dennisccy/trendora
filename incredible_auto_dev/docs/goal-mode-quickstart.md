# Goal Mode Quick Start

Goal mode is an autonomous, continuous mode of the AI Multi-Agent Dev Chain. You define a product goal once; the system iterates `decompose → execute → evaluate` until the goal is achieved or it halts with a clear cause.

For phase-by-phase mode (still fully supported), see the main [README](../README.md). For the architecture details, see [`.claude/architecture/goal-mode.md`](../.claude/architecture/goal-mode.md).

## When to use goal mode vs phase mode

| Use **phase mode** when … | Use **goal mode** when … |
|---|---|
| You have a clear, decomposed roadmap | You have a vision and want the system to figure out the steps |
| You want a human gate between every phase | You're happy reviewing the result at the end of a session |
| Your work doesn't have observable user journeys (pure infra refactor) | The product is testable via concrete user flows in a browser |
| You want full pipeline rigor on every change | You want adaptive depth — lean cycles where appropriate, full pipeline when risk is high |

You can use both modes in the same project. They write to disjoint artifact namespaces.

## 4-step setup

### 1. Author `docs/goal.md`

Start from `templates/project-goal.md` and fill in every section. The two sections required by goal mode (and ignored by phase mode) are:

```markdown
## Must-have user journeys

- **J-01: Sign up and log in**
  - Steps:
    1. Visit `/signup`
    2. Enter `user@example.com` / `password123`
    3. Submit form, expect redirect to `/dashboard`
    4. Click "Log out"
    5. Visit `/login`, enter same credentials, expect `/dashboard` again
  - Acceptance: dashboard greeting shows the user's email

- **J-02: Create a todo with a tag**
  - Steps: …
  - Acceptance: …

## Anti-goals

- No hard-coded credentials, API keys, or tokens in source.
- Auth tokens MUST NOT be stored in `localStorage`.
- No dependency on a paid SaaS service unless explicitly listed in Constraints.
```

Each journey needs a unique ID (`J-NN`), numbered click/type/assert steps that the browser-qa-agent can execute via Chrome MCP, and an "Acceptance" line describing the observable end state. Anti-goals must be concrete, checkable rules — not aspirations.

If either section is missing or empty, `run-goal.sh` aborts with a clear error message (this is anti-pattern #18).

**Optional but high-leverage — `## Product Shape`.** You can also sketch the app's navigation / information architecture and list the *canonical values* (metrics or entities that must read the same everywhere they appear). The goal-decomposer drafts a coherence **blueprint** from this at baseline; if you leave it blank, it proposes one from your journeys. Naming canonical values here is the single best defense against the "the same number shows different values on different pages" problem. You review and approve the blueprint once (see step 3).

### 2. Configure `.claude/project-template.md`

Same as phase mode: name your project, declare your stack, list test commands, set architecture rules, etc.

### 3. Run

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app
```

This will:
1. Validate `docs/goal.md`
2. Initialize `runs/goal-session-my-app/`
3. Run iteration 0 (baseline): the goal-decomposer writes a verify-only spec **and drafts the coherence blueprint** (`state/blueprint.md`), then browser-qa runs every Must-have journey against the current codebase to figure out what already passes (handy for existing projects) and what needs work
4. **Pause once for blueprint approval.** After baseline, the loop stops (`AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL`) so you can review the drafted blueprint (~3 min — see below). Edit it if needed; your edits are the approval. Then `--resume`. Skip this entirely with `--auto-approve-blueprint`.
5. Loop iterations 1, 2, 3 … each iteration: decomposer picks the next chunk of failing journeys → lean or full pipeline executes → **coherence-auditor checks the change against the blueprint** → evaluator scores → loop or halt

**Reviewing the blueprint (the one-time pause):** open `runs/goal-session-my-app/state/blueprint.md` and check two things — (1) **Information Architecture**: are the nav sections sensible and does every feature have an obvious home? (2) **Data Contract**: is every "same-number-everywhere" value listed with exactly one source? Add any the AI missed; fix wrong sources. Edit the file directly, then `--resume` (resuming counts as approval).

You can leave it running unattended. The framework's existing quota auto-resume (`claude_with_quota_retry`) handles API limits transparently — when the quota resets, the iteration resumes from where it paused.

### 4. Inspect the result

When the loop halts, read:

- `runs/goal-session-my-app/summary.md` — final verdict, journey-by-journey status, total iterations, wall time
- `runs/goal-session-my-app/state/evaluator-log.md` — chronicle of every iteration's evaluator decision
- `runs/goal-session-my-app/telemetry.jsonl` — structured event log for analysis

…or **watch the product run** in a real browser with plain-language narration in
your terminal (press Enter to step through it):

```bash
./scripts/automation/demo.sh my-app --session-live   # live tour of the WHOLE product built so far
./scripts/automation/demo.sh goal-my-app-iter-3 --live  # live tour of one iteration
./scripts/automation/demo.sh my-app                   # open the recorded gallery / session index instead
```

See the "Watch your app" section of the [README](../README.md) for what to
expect and prerequisites (it needs a display; works over SSH X11 forwarding).

Halt verdicts:
- `GOAL_ACHIEVED` — every Must-have journey passes, no anti-goal violations
- `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` — hit `--max-iter` cap; resume with a higher cap to continue
- `STALLED` — no journey progress for `--stall-window` iterations; edit `goal.md` (clearer journeys, narrower scope) and `--resume`
- `REGRESSION_HALT` — a previously-passing journey now fails; review, fix manually if needed, then resume with `--acknowledge-regression`
- `AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL` — paused after baseline (or after a structural blueprint change) for you to review `state/blueprint.md`; `--resume` to continue (counts as approval), or pre-empt with `--auto-approve-blueprint`
- `AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH` — paused at startup because per-iter push is on but a push to `origin` wouldn't authenticate (expired GitHub session, or no remote); fix auth (the run will offer to launch `gh auth login` for you when interactive) and `--resume`

## Common workflows

### Resume after laptop suspend or quota pause

The framework already handles both transparently — quota exhaustion sleeps until reset, system suspends use wall-clock-aware sleeps. If you want to manually pause: Ctrl-C; the trap writes an `ABORTED` summary. Then:

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app
```

### Recover from `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app --max-iter 50
```

### Recover from `REGRESSION_HALT`

1. Read `runs/goal-session-my-app/iter-<N>/eval.md` to see which journey regressed and why
2. Fix the regression manually OR adjust the goal (the regression may indicate a journey was poorly specified)
3. Resume:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app --acknowledge-regression
   ```

### Recover from `AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH`

Because per-iter push is on by default, goal mode checks once at startup that a push
to `origin` would authenticate — so an expired GitHub session can't silently stall a
mid-run push on a username/password prompt. If the check fails in an interactive
terminal, the run offers to launch `gh auth login` for you, then continues. If it's
running unattended (or `gh` isn't installed), it pauses as `AWAITING_GITHUB_AUTH`:

```bash
gh auth login        # refresh the GitHub session
gh auth setup-git    # let git use the gh credential for HTTPS push
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app   # re-checks, then continues
```

Pushes are also hardened so they can never block on a credential prompt — if the
session expires mid-run, that iteration's push fails fast and the loop continues
(the commit stays local and pushes on the next iteration once you re-auth). Skip the
startup check entirely with `export CHAIN_SKIP_GITHUB_PREFLIGHT=true` (for exotic
credential setups), or run without pushing via `--no-push-per-iter`.

### Review and approve the blueprint (or skip it)

After baseline, the loop pauses with `AWAITING_BLUEPRINT_APPROVAL`. Review the drafted blueprint, edit if needed, and resume:

```bash
$EDITOR runs/goal-session-my-app/state/blueprint.md   # check IA + Data Contract
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app   # resuming = approval
```

To skip the pause entirely and use the AI's draft as-is (fully hands-off):

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app --auto-approve-blueprint
```

`--auto-approve-blueprint` is a per-run flag — pass it on each invocation/resume to keep it on. It also auto-accepts any later structural blueprint change.

### Start over

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --reset --session-id my-app
```

This deletes `runs/goal-session-my-app/` and starts fresh.

### Auto-create a PR when the goal is reached

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app --auto-release
```

The release-manager runs once at the end of the session (not per iteration), creating a feature branch and PR for the entire body of work. Requires authenticated `gh` CLI.

### Push every iteration to a session branch (default ON)

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app
```

Per-iter push is **on by default** for new sessions. `goal/my-app` is created from current HEAD and one commit lands per successful iteration (CONTINUE / ESCALATE / GOAL_ACHIEVED). `REGRESSION` and `STALLED` halts skip the push so the remote isn't left in a state you haven't reviewed. No model invocation per push — direct shell `git`. Override the branch name with `--push-branch <name>`.

To opt out for a particular session:

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id my-app --no-push-per-iter
```

To opt in mid-session for a session that was started without push (or a session that pre-dates this feature), pass `--push-per-iter` on resume:

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --resume --session-id my-app --push-per-iter
```

The branch is created from current HEAD on first resume, and the choice is persisted to `session.json` so subsequent resumes pick it up automatically. Prior iters' code stays on whatever branch it was committed to before — only iters from this point forward accumulate on the new branch.

You can also flip the other way: `--no-push-per-iter` on resume disables push for this run AND persists `push_per_iter: false`, so future resumes respect the change.

The `summary.md` written when the loop halts includes a ready-to-paste `gh pr create` command. PR creation itself is still manual (or use `--auto-release` for the existing end-of-session PR flow).

Each iteration's commit message includes the verdict and the journey delta counts, so `git log goal/my-app` is a reviewable timeline of the session:

```
goal(my-app): iter 4 — CONTINUE (passing+1 failing+0 regressed+0)
goal(my-app): iter 3 — ESCALATE (passing+0 failing+1 regressed+0)
goal(my-app): iter 2 — CONTINUE (passing+2 failing+0 regressed+0)
goal(my-app): iter 1 — CONTINUE (passing+1 failing+0 regressed+0)
goal(my-app): iter 0 — CONTINUE (passing+0 failing+3 regressed+0)
```

## Worked example: tiny goal

Here's a minimal `goal.md` that demonstrates goal mode end-to-end:

```markdown
# Project Goal

## Vision
A static page that shows the current UTC time when the user clicks a button.

## Target Users
A developer demoing this framework's goal mode.

## Success Criteria
- Page renders at /
- Time updates on button click

## Key Capabilities
1. Display the current UTC time
2. Refresh the time on button click

## Non-Goals
- No persistence, no backend, no auth, no styling beyond default.

## Constraints
- Single-page Next.js app, no external deps beyond what the framework allows.

## Design Direction
- Visual style: minimal-clean
- Mood: neutral

## Must-have user journeys

- **J-01: Page loads with current time**
  - Steps:
    1. Visit `/`
    2. Read the time element
  - Acceptance: a time string in `HH:MM:SS UTC` format is visible on the page

- **J-02: Refresh button updates the time**
  - Steps:
    1. Visit `/`
    2. Note the displayed time
    3. Click the button labeled "Refresh"
    4. Read the time element again
  - Acceptance: the displayed time has advanced by at least 1 second

## Anti-goals

- No third-party time API; the time MUST be derived from the browser or server clock only.
- No external CSS framework — keep dependencies minimal.
```

Then:

```bash
./scripts/automation/run-goal.sh --session-id tiny-clock --max-iter 5 --auto-approve-blueprint
```

(`--auto-approve-blueprint` skips the one-time blueprint review so this demo runs unattended; drop it if you want to review the drafted IA + Data Contract first.) A typical run for this goal completes in 2-3 iterations (baseline finds nothing exists → iter 1 builds the page → iter 2 verifies). The total wall time is dominated by build/test execution, not Claude calls.
