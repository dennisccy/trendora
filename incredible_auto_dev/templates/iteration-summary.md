<!-- Three short, labelled parts. Each 1-3 plain sentences. -->

**What you can do now:** <Plain-language list of capabilities the product actually delivers to a user today. Frame as actions the user can take ("Sign in with email", "Save a draft and come back to it"). Aggregate of every passing journey so far in goal mode, or the cumulative end-user surface so far in phase mode.>

**What changed this time:** <Plain-language description of what is newly available or fixed this iteration. Tie it back to the user's experience ("You can now invite a teammate by email"). If nothing user-facing changed, say "Behind-the-scenes work — nothing visibly new this round" and name the area in friendly terms.>

**What's next:** <Plain-language recommendation, derived from the technical Next step. Phrase it as the next thing the product will get to do for the user.>
