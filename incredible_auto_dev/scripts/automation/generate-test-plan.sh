Apply the TOKEN AND QUESTIONING POLICY from .claude/core.md strictly.
Do not ask questions — derive all test cases from the phase spec.

Write the functional test plan to: $TEST_PLAN

The plan must include:
- Phase goal summary
- Numbered test cases (TC-01, TC-02, ...)
- For each test case: type, preconditions, steps, expected outcome, pass criteria
- A summary of total test cases by type

Keep it concise (1-3 pages). Write the plan and STOP."
