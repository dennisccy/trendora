#
# Usage: ./scripts/automation/goal-iter-lean.sh <iter-name>
#   <iter-name> is the synthetic phase name `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>`.
#
# A lean iteration is the stripped-down execution path used when the
# goal-decomposer marks an iteration as `Depth: lean`. It runs:
#   1. developer  (TDD implementation from the iter spec)
#   2. reviewer   (max 2 attempts; second is a fix-mode developer pass + reviewer re-run)
#   3. browser-qa-agent  (runs only the journeys named in the iter spec's "Target journeys")
#
# Skipped (vs full pipeline run-phase.sh): orchestrator, qa test-plan generator,
# ui-impact-analyst, ui-test-designer, qa validator, ux-regression-reviewer,
# auditor, phase-closure-auditor, release-manager.
#
# SPEED-2: with CHAIN_LEAN_PARALLEL_BROWSER_QA=replay (default off), the
# browser-qa service boot + deterministic replay lane is forked right after the
# developer step and joined once the review loop settles; a review-1 FAIL kills
# the fork BEFORE any step invalidation (see the fork block below).
#
# SPEED-3: =full (headless backends ONLY; the interactive backend demotes to
# replay with a warning — killing an engine-side waiter would strand the
# pump's subagent, EXP-4's cancellation gap) forks the WHOLE browser-qa
# section, LLM lane included. The join translates a transport exit (70) from
# inside the fork into the same resumable engine pause the sequential path
# takes, and a review-1 FAIL kills the fork tree (in-flight dispatch included)
# before any invalidation.
#
# The outer run-goal.sh runs the goal-evaluator after this script returns.
#
# All Claude calls go through claude_with_quota_retry → --effort max + auto-resume on quota.

# So we split the work:
#   • LLM browser-qa-agent → only the NEW/changed (Target) journeys (judgment
#     needed), plus any regression journey that has no golden script yet.
#   • deterministic replay → already-passing journeys WITH a stored golden script

#     demo_runner.py --mode verify (no model in the loop → minutes, not hours).
# A replay FAIL is re-confirmed by the LLM (a brittle selector must not fake a
# regression and halt the session). With NO golden scripts on file the regression
# set falls entirely to the LLM lane — behaviour is then identical to before, and
# the speedup switches on by itself as golden scripts accumulate. Disable with
# CHAIN_REGRESSION_REPLAY=false.
