# replay-lane.sh — the deterministic regression-replay lane, shared by BOTH
# goal-mode depths:
#   • lean  — goal-iter-lean.sh (run_browser_qa_boot_and_replay + section merge)
#   • full  — browser-qa-phase.sh (goal-session iterations only; plain phase
#             mode never calls into this file)
#
# ONE implementation, no copy-paste (P2 fix: previously the lane existed only in
# the lean executor, so every FULL goal-mode iteration structurally deferred its
# Required-still-passing re-verification to a follow-up lean pass — five
# evaluator-flagged recurrences and one extra terminal iteration in the
# 43-iteration production session).
#
# The lane, end to end:
#   1. Parse the iteration spec's journey sets (replay_lane_spec_journeys).
#   2. Partition Required-still-passing into replay-able (LINTABLE golden script
#      on file under runs/goal-session-<sid>/journey-scripts/) vs LLM journeys;
#      a golden that fails lint is quarantined (*.json.invalid) and its journey
#      routed to the LLM lane (replay_lane_partition_and_verify).
#   3. Replay the golden set with demo_runner.py --mode verify (no model in the
#      loop). rc contract (demo_runner.py docstring): 0 = all pass; 5 = journey
#      FAIL(s) → REPLAY_FAILED is re-confirmed by the LLM lane (a brittle
#      selector must not fake a regression and halt the session) and is NEVER
#      retried here — re-rolling assertions would mask real regressions; 6 =
#      browser-INFRA failure (launch/crash) → re-check services + retry ONCE
#      (REL-5), a second rc-6 records the lane as SKIPPED-INFRA (raw-artifact
#      verdict line + REPLAY_SKIPPED_INFRA global + telemetry — distinct from
#      FAIL and from the REL-12 frontend-skip) and falls back; any other rc =
#      lane infrastructure failure → no retry, ALL replay journeys fall back
#      to the LLM lane, byte-identical to running with
#      CHAIN_REGRESSION_REPLAY=false.
#   4. Merge replay + LLM results into the single authoritative
#      reports/phase-<iter>-ui-test-results.md the goal-evaluator AND the
#      deterministic achievement gate read (LLM listed last → wins on any
#      journey both lanes touched), then reconcile the raw replay artifact so
#      an overturned replay FAIL cannot survive on disk as a contradiction
#      (replay_lane_merge_results).
#
# Escape hatch: CHAIN_REGRESSION_REPLAY=false routes the whole regression set
# to the LLM lane at both depths (replay_lane_llm_regression_set).
#
# Callers set REPLAY_LANE_TAG so lane log lines keep their script's prefix —
# goal-iter-lean.sh's stdout stays byte-identical (benchmark runs diff
# normalized stdout).
#
# Dataflow is via GLOBALS, deliberately: goal-iter-lean.sh's SPEED-2 fork
# serializes exactly these names through its state file (_bqa_state_save), so
# they are a cross-process contract, not a style choice.
