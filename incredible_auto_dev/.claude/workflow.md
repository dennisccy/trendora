# Workflow — Phase Execution Pipeline (and Goal Mode)

This file defines how phases are executed, how agents interact, and what constitutes success. The phase pipeline is the foundation; goal mode wraps it with an outer adaptive loop (covered at the end of this document).

---

## Pipeline Overview

Each phase flows through 6 stages, driven by `scripts/automation/run-phase.sh`:

```
Plan → Test Plan → Dev+Review loop → QA loop → Audit loop → Finalize
```

| Stage | Script | Agent | Output |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Plan | `run-phase.sh` (internal) | orchestrator | `runs/<phase>/plan.md` (reads `docs/goal.md` + `docs/architecture/` + `.claude/architecture/` + prior handoffs first) |
| 2. Test Plan | `generate-test-plan.sh` | qa (mode: generate) | `reports/qa/<phase>-test-plan.md` — dispatch skipped (loudly logged) when the spec already lists its own tests (`## Test`-titled section or ≥3 `TC-` lines) and `CHAIN_SKIP_TESTPLAN_IF_PRESENT=true` (default `false`; TOKEN-3) |
| 3. Dev + Review | `dev-phase.sh` + `review-phase.sh` | developer, reviewer | `docs/handoffs/<phase>-dev.md`, `reports/phase-{N}-implementation-summary.md` |
| 4. UI Impact Analysis | `ui-impact-phase.sh` | ui-impact-analyst | `reports/phase-{N}-user-visible-changes.md`, `reports/phase-{N}-ui-surface-map.md` |
| 5. UI Test Design | `ui-test-design-phase.sh` | ui-test-designer | `reports/phase-{N}-ui-test-plan.md`, `reports/phase-{N}-what-to-click.md` |
| 6. Browser QA | `browser-qa-phase.sh` | browser-qa-agent | `reports/phase-{N}-ui-test-results.md` |
| 7. QA | `qa-phase.sh` | qa (mode: validate) | `reports/qa/<phase>-qa.md` |
| 8. UX Regression Review | `ux-regression-phase.sh` | ux-regression-reviewer | `reports/phase-{N}-ux-regression.md` |
| 9. Audit | `phase-audit.sh` | auditor | `docs/handoffs/<phase>-audit.md` |
| 10. Phase Closure | `phase-closure-check.sh` | phase-closure-auditor | `reports/phase-{N}-closure-verdict.md` |
| 11. Finalize | `finalize-phase.sh` | release-manager | `runs/<phase>/summary.json`, PR (then updates `docs/architecture/` via `update-docs.sh`, non-blocking) |

*Stages 5, 6, 8 are skipped for backend-only phases (`Frontend Present: no`) — N/A stubs are written automatically.*

## Retry Policy

- **Dev+Review loop**: max 3 attempts. On review FAIL, developer fixes listed issues, reviewer re-evaluates.
- **QA loop**: max 3 attempts. On QA FAIL, developer fixes, reviewer confirms, QA re-validates.
- **Audit loop**: max 3 attempts (`MAX_AUDIT_RETRIES`). On audit FAIL, developer + reviewer + full QA re-run before the auditor re-evaluates — but the full (QA-inclusive) rerun is capped at `CHAIN_AUDIT_RERUN_CAP` completed passes per run (default 1; `0` = uncapped, the pre-cap behavior); later FAILs harden in fix-only mode (developer + reviewer + audit re-check, no full QA rerun), loudly logged each time (TOKEN-4).
- After max retries are exhausted, the pipeline halts with a FAILED status.

## Artifact-Based Communication

Agents ONLY communicate through filesystem artifacts. No free-form messages between agents.

**Artifact locations:**

| Artifact | Path | Written by | Read by |
|----------|------|------------|---------|
| Phase spec | `docs/phases/<phase>.md` | Human | All agents |
| Execution plan | `runs/<phase>/plan.md` | orchestrator | developer, reviewer, qa, auditor |
| Test plan | `reports/qa/<phase>-test-plan.md` | qa (generate mode) | qa (validate mode) |
| Dev handoff | `docs/handoffs/<phase>-dev.md` | developer | reviewer, qa, auditor |
| Frontend handoff | `docs/handoffs/<phase>-frontend.md` | developer | reviewer, qa, auditor |
| Audit report | `docs/handoffs/<phase>-audit.md` | auditor | release-manager |
| Review report | `reports/reviews/<phase>-review.md` | reviewer | qa, developer (fix mode) |
| QA report | `reports/qa/<phase>-qa.md` | qa | auditor, release-manager |
| Phase status | `runs/<phase>/status.json` | scripts + agents | scripts |
| Phase summary | `runs/<phase>/summary.json` | finalize script | release-manager |
| Implementation summary | `reports/phase-{N}-implementation-summary.md` | developer | ui-impact-analyst, phase-closure-auditor |
| User-visible changes | `reports/phase-{N}-user-visible-changes.md` | ui-impact-analyst | ui-test-designer, ux-regression-reviewer, phase-closure-auditor |
| UI surface map | `reports/phase-{N}-ui-surface-map.md` | ui-impact-analyst | ui-test-designer, browser-qa-agent, ux-regression-reviewer |
| UI test plan | `reports/phase-{N}-ui-test-plan.md` | ui-test-designer | browser-qa-agent, phase-closure-auditor |
| UI test results | `reports/phase-{N}-ui-test-results.md` | browser-qa-agent | ux-regression-reviewer, phase-closure-auditor |
| What to click | `reports/phase-{N}-what-to-click.md` | ui-test-designer | operator (human), phase-closure-auditor |
| UX regression report | `reports/phase-{N}-ux-regression.md` | ux-regression-reviewer | phase-closure-auditor |
| Closure verdict | `reports/phase-{N}-closure-verdict.md` | phase-closure-auditor | finalize-phase.sh |
| Project goal | `docs/goal.md` | Human | orchestrator, developer, reviewer, qa |
| Project architecture | `docs/architecture/*.md` | update-docs.sh | orchestrator, developer |
| Framework architecture | `.claude/architecture/*.md` | update-docs.sh | All agents (reference) |

## Checkpoint / Resume Protocol

Every phase run is tracked in `runs/<phase>/status.json`. If a run is interrupted, re-running `run-phase.sh` resumes from the last completed step.

**State machine:**

| `current_step` | Steps skipped on resume |
|---|---|
| `planned` | Plan |
| `test_plan_generated` | Plan, test plan |
| `dev_complete_attempt_*` | Plan, test plan; first dev pass (review re-runs) |
| `review_passed` | Plan, test plan, dev+review |
| `qa_passed` | Plan, test plan, dev+review, QA |
| `ui_impact_complete` | Plan, test plan, dev+review, UI impact analysis |
| `ui_test_designed` | Plan, test plan, dev+review, UI impact, UI test design |
| `browser_qa_complete` | Plan, test plan, dev+review, UI impact, UI test design, browser QA |
| `ux_regression_complete` | Plan through UX regression review |
| `closure_passed` | All steps except finalize |
| `audit_passed` | Plan, test plan, dev+review, QA, audit |
| `summary.json` finalized | All steps — exits immediately |

Use `--reset` flag to clear checkpoints and re-run all steps.

## Verdict Formats (machine-read)

**All reports use the same universal format:**
```
**Verdict:** VALUE
```

The `**Verdict:**` prefix is required — `verdict_passes()` in `common.sh` delegates to
`scripts/automation/lib/verdicts.py`, which is the single source of truth for valid values.

**Review report** (`reports/reviews/<phase>-review.md`) — first line:
```
**Verdict:** PASS
**Verdict:** PASS_WITH_NOTES
**Verdict:** FAIL
```

**QA report** (`reports/qa/<phase>-qa.md`) — first line:
```
**Verdict:** PASS
**Verdict:** PASS_WITH_NOTES
**Verdict:** FAIL
```

**Audit report** (`docs/handoffs/<phase>-audit.md`) — in Executive Verdict section:
```
**Verdict:** PASS
**Verdict:** PASS_WITH_GAPS
**Verdict:** FAIL
```

**UI Evolution Audit** (inside QA report):
```
**Verdict:** UI-PASS
**Verdict:** UI-PASS-WITH-GAPS
**Verdict:** UI-FAIL
```

**Phase Closure Verdict** (`reports/phase-{N}-closure-verdict.md`):
```
**Verdict:** CLOSURE-PASS
**Verdict:** CLOSURE-FAIL
```

**UX Regression Report** (`reports/phase-{N}-ux-regression.md`):
```
**Verdict:** UX-REGRESSION-PASS
**Verdict:** UX-REGRESSION-WARN
**Verdict:** UX-REGRESSION-FAIL
```

If verdict format is wrong, scripts cannot detect PASS and will loop indefinitely.

---

## UI Evolution Policy

For every phase where the backend adds user-facing capability:

1. The UI MUST evolve to expose that capability
2. New entity types MUST have list + detail pages reachable from navigation
3. The sidebar/navigation MUST be updated if a new top-level workflow is introduced
4. A phase MUST NOT be considered complete if the backend changed but the UI did not reflect it

**UI Evolution Audit (conducted by qa agent when `Frontend Present: yes`):**

Answer each question:
1. Did the UI evolve to reflect the phase's new capability?
2. Can the user now see, understand, and control the new capability from the UI?
3. Is the UI still relying on old generic pages for new functionality?
4. Is the implementation technically complete but product-wise underexposed?

Assign:
- `UI-PASS` — UI meaningfully reflects the new capability
- `UI-PASS-WITH-GAPS` — UI works but has notable gaps (list each)
- `UI-FAIL` — backend capability is not adequately reflected in the UI

**If UI-FAIL: overall QA verdict MUST be FAIL.**
**If Frontend Present: no — skip UI audit entirely.**

---

## State and Lifecycle Rules

- Each entity must have clear status enums
- State transitions must be explicit and validated in backend logic
- Invalid transitions must be rejected (not silently ignored)
- Every important state change must be recorded with a timestamp and payload (audit trail)
- Do NOT rely on frontend for validation of business rules

---

## Plan Format

The orchestrator writes `runs/<phase>/plan.md` in this exact structure (machine-read by scripts):

```markdown
# <phase> Execution Plan

## What to Build
- <feature 1>
- <feature 2>

## Agents Required
- developer: yes/no -- <what to implement>
- (additional specializations if needed)

## Frontend Present
yes/no

## Files to Create/Modify
- `path/to/file` -- <description>

## UI Evolution (required if Frontend Present: yes)
- New user-facing capability: <what user can now see/do>
- New information displayed: <new data visible>
- New user actions: <buttons/forms/controls added>
- UI surface changes: <pages/panels added or improved>
- Navigation changes: <sidebar links added, or "none">

## Key Test Scenarios
- <scenario that must pass for phase to be complete>
```

The `Frontend Present:` line is machine-read by `qa-phase.sh` to decide whether Chrome MCP browser checks are required. Write it **exactly** as shown above.

---

## Git and GitHub Workflow

- Branch naming: `phase/<phase-id>`
- PR title format: `feat: <phase-id> — <one-line summary>`
- PRs are created after audit passes (or QA passes if no auditor configured)
- NEVER force-push main
- NEVER amend published commits
- Files listed in project-template.md `never-commit` section must not be staged

---

## Model Tier Rationale

| Tier | Model | Used for |
|------|-------|----------|
| strong | claude-opus-4-8 | Judgment: goal evaluation/decomposition, skeptical audit, confirms |
| standard | claude-sonnet-5 | Solid tasks: code review, test plan generation |
| light | claude-haiku-4-5 | Routine workflow: QA execution, git/GitHub operations |

Model assignments: each agent picks a tier (`model_tier`) in `agents/<name>/agent.yaml`; the tier resolves to a concrete model in `config/model-tiers.yaml`. Edit those, then re-render with `python3 scripts/automation/sync-cli-assets.py --cli claude` and commit the regenerated `.claude/agents/*.md`.

---

## Goal Mode Pipeline

Goal mode is an outer loop that wraps the phase pipeline. It is the second supported execution mode of this framework — see [`.claude/architecture/goal-mode.md`](architecture/goal-mode.md) for internals and [`docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md`](../docs/goal-mode-quickstart.md) for user-facing usage.

### When goal mode runs

`scripts/automation/run-goal.sh` drives the loop. It validates `docs/goal.md` (must contain non-empty Must-have user journeys + Anti-goals sections — see anti-pattern #18) and then iterates:

```
loop:
  1. halt checks (max-iter | stall via journey-history hash | regression flag)
  2. goal-decomposer  → docs/phases/goal-<sid>-iter-<N>.md  (Mode: baseline|next, Depth: lean|full)
  3. dispatch:
       depth=lean  → goal-iter-lean.sh <iter-name>
                     (developer → reviewer (max 2) → browser-qa-agent)
       depth=full  → run-phase.sh <iter-name> --no-finalize
                     (existing 11-step pipeline)
  4. goal-evaluator  → runs/goal-session-<sid>/iter-<N>/eval.md
                     + updated journey-history.json + appended evaluator-log.md
  5. parse verdict; halt or continue
```

Iteration name `goal-<sid>-iter-<N>` is used as the "phase name" for downstream agents and scripts, so the phase pipeline runs unchanged.

### Goal-mode artifacts

| Artifact | Path | Producer |
|---|---|---|
| Iteration spec | `docs/phases/goal-<sid>-iter-<N>.md` | goal-decomposer |
| Session state | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/session.json` | run-goal.sh |
| Journey history | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/state/journey-history.json` | goal-evaluator |
| Evaluator log | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/state/evaluator-log.md` | goal-evaluator (append-only) |
| Iter eval | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/iter-<N>/eval.md` | goal-evaluator |
| Telemetry | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl` | run-goal.sh + goal-iter-lean.sh + lib/telemetry.sh |
| Session summary | `runs/goal-session-<sid>/summary.md` | run-goal.sh (on halt) |

Per-iteration code/test artifacts use the standard phase-mode paths (`runs/<iter-name>/`, `reports/...<iter-name>...`) — the iteration name is just a "phase name" from those scripts' perspective.

### Goal-mode verdicts

| Verdict | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GOAL_ACHIEVED` | Loop halts with success. Optionally invokes release-manager once for the whole session (`--auto-release`). |
| `CONTINUE` | Loop continues with evaluator's recommended depth. |
| `ESCALATE` | Loop continues; next iteration MUST run as full. |
| `REGRESSION` | Loop halts with `REGRESSION_HALT`. User reviews, fixes if needed, resumes with `--acknowledge-regression`. |
| `STALLED` | Loop halts (evaluator-driven; the script also detects stall by journey-history hash repetition). User edits `goal.md`, then `--resume`. |

### Goal-mode halt conditions (loop level)

| Halt | Detected by | User recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` | `current_iter >= max_iterations` (only when `--max-iter N` is set; **no cap by default**) | `run-goal.sh --resume --max-iter N` (raised cap) |
| `STALLED` (hash) | Last `stall_window` (default 3) journey-history hashes are identical | Edit `goal.md`, then `--resume` |
| `REGRESSION_HALT` | Evaluator emitted `REGRESSION` | `run-goal.sh --resume --acknowledge-regression` |
| `ABORTED` | SIGINT/SIGTERM | `run-goal.sh --resume --session-id <id>` |
| Quota exhausted | (handled by `claude_with_quota_retry`) | NOT a halt — loop pauses and auto-resumes when quota resets |

### Goal-mode retry policy

- **Lean iteration developer→reviewer**: max 2 attempts (tighter than phase mode's 3 — lean cycles favor escalation over local thrashing).
- **Full iteration**: full phase-mode retry policy (3 dev+review, 3 QA, 2 audit) applies via `run-phase.sh`.
- **Quota retry**: every Claude call goes through `lib/quota-retry.sh::claude_with_quota_retry` which passes `--effort max` and handles quota exhaustion transparently.

### Goal-mode telemetry

Every step in the loop emits a structured event to `runs/goal-session-<sid>/telemetry.jsonl`. Event types include `session_start`, `iter_start`, `decomposer_start`, `decomposer_end`, `iter_dispatch`, `agent_invocation_start`, `agent_invocation_end`, `evaluator_end`, `iter_end`, `halt`, `session_end`. See [`docs/goal-mode-telemetry.md`](../docs/goal-mode-telemetry.md) for the full schema.

Telemetry is local-only — nothing is exported. The `feedback/` directory is reserved for a future self-evolution loop (see `feedback/README.md`).
