# Project Configuration Template

Copy this file into your project's `.claude/` directory and fill in every section.
Agents read this file to understand your project's stack, conventions, and constraints.

---

## PROJECT GOAL

```
Goal document: docs/goal.md
```

Fill in `docs/goal.md` (use `templates/project-goal.md` as a starting point).
The goal doc defines the project's vision, target users, success criteria, key capabilities, and non-goals/scope boundaries.
All agents read this before starting any phase to ensure alignment.

---

## PROJECT

```
Name:        <your project name>
Description: <one-line description of what this project does>
Repository:  <git remote URL>
```

---

## STACK

Define your technology stack. Agents use this to know which commands to run and which files to touch.

```
Backend:
  Language:   <e.g., Python 3.12>
  Framework:  <e.g., FastAPI, Django, Express, Rails>
  ORM/DB lib: <e.g., SQLAlchemy 2.0, Prisma, ActiveRecord>
  Migrations: <e.g., Alembic, Flyway, Prisma Migrate, rake db:migrate>
  Test runner: <e.g., pytest, jest, rspec>
  Package mgr: <e.g., pip + uv, npm, cargo, bundler>
  Venv/env:   <e.g., apps/backend/.venv/, node_modules/ (auto)>

Frontend:
  Enabled:    yes/no
  Framework:  <e.g., Next.js 15 App Router, Vue 3, SvelteKit> (or "N/A")
  Language:   <e.g., TypeScript>
  Styling:    <e.g., CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components>
  Package mgr: <e.g., npm, pnpm, yarn>

Database:
  Type:       <e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB>
  Location:   <e.g., apps/backend/app.db, postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb>

Services:
  Backend URL:  http://localhost:<port>
  Frontend URL: http://localhost:<port>  (or "N/A")
  Health check: <e.g., http://localhost:8000/health>
```

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM

Define your project's visual identity. Agents use this to ensure consistent, polished UI output.

```
Component library: <e.g., shadcn/ui, Radix + Tailwind, Material UI, Chakra UI>
Icon library:      <e.g., Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor>

Visual style:      <e.g., cyber-dark, minimal-light, corporate-clean>
Color mode:        <dark / light / system>

Color palette:
  Background:      <e.g., #0a0a0f — deep dark base>
  Surface:         <e.g., #12121a — card/panel background>
  Border:          <e.g., #1e1e2e — subtle borders>
  Primary:         <e.g., #00f0ff — neon cyan accent>
  Secondary:       <e.g., #7c3aed — electric purple>
  Success:         <e.g., #10b981>
  Warning:         <e.g., #f59e0b>
  Danger:          <e.g., #ef4444>
  Text primary:    <e.g., #e2e8f0 — high contrast on dark>
  Text muted:      <e.g., #64748b>

Typography:
  Font family:     <e.g., Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for code/data>
  Scale:           <e.g., Tailwind default: text-sm/base/lg/xl/2xl>

Spacing:           <e.g., Tailwind default 4px grid: p-1/p-2/p-3/p-4/p-6/p-8>

Effects (use sparingly):
  - <e.g., glassmorphism on cards: backdrop-blur-md bg-white/5 border border-white/10>
  - <e.g., glow on primary actions: shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(0,240,255,0.3)]>
  - <e.g., subtle gradient borders on hero sections>
  - <e.g., smooth transitions: transition-all duration-200>

Responsive breakpoints: <e.g., sm:640px md:768px lg:1024px xl:1280px>
```

## TEST COMMANDS

Agents will run these to validate their work. Be exact.

```
Backend tests:  <e.g., cd apps/backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v>
Frontend tests: <e.g., cd apps/frontend && npm test -- --passWithNoTests> (or "N/A")
Migrations:     <e.g., cd apps/backend && .venv/bin/alembic upgrade head> (or "N/A")
Lint:           <e.g., cd apps/backend && .venv/bin/ruff check .> (or "N/A")
```

---

## SERVICE START COMMANDS

Used by qa-phase.sh to auto-start services during QA validation.

```
Start backend:  <e.g., bash scripts/start-backend.sh> (or set CHAIN_START_BACKEND_CMD env var)
Start frontend: <e.g., bash scripts/start-frontend.sh> (or set CHAIN_START_FRONTEND_CMD env var)
```

---

## PHASE SPECS

```
Phase spec directory:   docs/phases/
Phase spec naming:      <phase-id>.md  OR  <phase-id>-<name>.md
                        Example: phase-3.md  OR  phase-3-user-auth.md
```

## ROADMAP

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| phase-1 | ... | ✅ Complete / 🔄 In Progress / Future |
| phase-2 | ... | Future |

---

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

List project-specific rules ALL agents must follow when writing code.
Example:
- Keep API routes thin — business logic lives in services, not routers
- All database access goes through the repository layer
- Frontend never contains business logic — calls backend APIs only
- Every resource has explicit status transitions; invalid transitions are rejected

```
- <principle 1>
- <principle 2>
- <principle 3>
```

---

## DATA MODEL RULES

Project-specific conventions for data modeling.
Example:
- Use UUID string primary keys (not auto-increment integers)
- All timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 strings
- JSON fields only where schema flexibility is explicitly required

```
- <rule 1>
- <rule 2>
```

---

## GIT WORKFLOW

```
Branch naming:      phase/<phase-id>
PR title format:    feat: <phase-id> — <one-line summary>
Main branch:        main
Never commit:
  - .env
  - *.db  (or your specific database file)
  - credentials.json
  - <any other project-specific secrets or large binaries>
```
