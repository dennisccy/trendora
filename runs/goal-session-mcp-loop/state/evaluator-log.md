## Iteration 0 — goal-mcp-loop-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-06-29T20:53:00Z
**Verdict:** ESCALATE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none
- Newly failing: none
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none (zero source diff — verify-only baseline)
- Seeded as UNKNOWN: J-01, J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05 (no browser evidence captured)

**Reasoning:** The baseline lean iteration's browser-QA lane never executed. telemetry.jsonl shows goal-decomposer → developer → reviewer → goal-evaluator with NO browser-qa-agent invocation; status.json reports browser_checks_run=false / current_step=dev_complete; reports/phase-goal-mcp-loop-iter-0-ui-test-results.md is absent and reports/qa/goal-mcp-loop-iter-0-evidence/ is empty (not even the goal-iter-lean.sh:392 SKIPPED stub was written). The iteration's sole deliverable — empirical J-01..J-05 verification — was therefore not produced, so all five journeys are UNKNOWN (I do not infer pass/fail from the developer's static code scan). git porcelain shows only untracked iteration artifacts (zero source diff) ⇒ no anti-goal could be violated; no coherence.md exists ⇒ no coherence veto (N/A on a no-op diff). Not REGRESSION (no prior-passing journey), not STALLED (iter 0, clear next step).

**Next-step recommendation:** Force a FULL iter-1 that stands up the read-side evidence path end to end — GET /api/evidence reading the certified-claims ledger via app.engine.ledger, the "Proven / Not yet proven" badge inline on /stocks + stock detail, the /evidence ledger page, and the Evidence nav entry — so that against the empty ledger every score honestly reads "Not yet proven" (structurally satisfies J-01, J-03, and J-05's ledger surface). Defer J-02 (drill into a PROVEN score) and J-04 (regime-conditioned PROVEN evidence) to a later iteration that proposes a `## Evidence Claim` and earns a referee PASS at the post-decompose gate (empty ledger ⇒ zero "Proven" badges by design). Full depth chosen because iter-1 introduces new public surfaces (nav section + page + cross-surface badges) needing ui-impact-analyst / ux-regression-reviewer / phase-closure gating, and because iter-0 captured no browser evidence the more robust full browser-QA lane should run next.
