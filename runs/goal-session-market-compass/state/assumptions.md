# Goal Session market-compass — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. Each entry records a scoring decision that required interpreting an
ambiguous goal, so the owner can veto it early.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-01's acceptance bundles four things (single stored source, >=95% coverage,
honest "Unassigned" for unknowns, methodology disclosure). goal.md does not say how to score a
journey where the honesty rails hold but the coverage target is missed by a wide margin.
**We chose:** Scored J-01 `partial` rather than `failing`, on the basis that some acceptance
steps genuinely passed with evidence (DELL/GRMN labels identical across leaderboard, stock detail
and API; unknown serves null, never a fabricated sector) while coverage (78.4% Unassigned vs the
<=5% target) and the methodology disclosure are entirely absent. `partial` here is a factual
record, not credit toward the deliverable — it does not support GOAL_ACHIEVED and the remaining
work is spelled out in the recommendation.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** goal.md's loop mechanics say "lean by default; full when an iteration first lands
user-visible UI changes", but do not say whether J-01 (mostly backend sector wiring plus one new
Methodology paragraph and changed sector labels on /stocks) counts as a user-visible UI change.
**We chose:** Treated it as user-visible and recommended `full` depth for iteration 1, because
the owner will see different sector labels on /stocks and new disclosure text on /methodology,
and because J-01's "scores must be byte-identical" and "never fabricate a sector" claims benefit
from the audit lane on this session's first product change.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-decomposer

**Ambiguity:** The agent instructions describe two related but not identical trigger sets for
depth=full: the "four escape conditions" that govern when a full spec is justified relative to
the evaluator's binding recommendation (prior ESCALATE/REGRESSION, prior coherence-audit FAIL,
hardening cadence due, or a brand-new full-stack journey) versus the four NUMBERED triggers
required in the `Full trigger:` metadata line (1 Structural/cross-cutting, 2 Data-model
migration, 3 Prior ESCALATE, 4 Hardening cadence). Neither text says how "brand-new full-stack
journey" (the condition that genuinely holds here — this is the session's first code-changing
iteration, matching goal.md's own "full when an iteration first lands user-visible UI changes"
rule) maps onto one of the four numbered triggers for the metadata line and the engine's
arbiter re-validation.
**We chose:** Cited numbered Trigger 1 (Structural/cross-cutting) in the metadata line, grounded
in an objective, mechanically-checkable fact rather than the "first UI" framing: this iteration's
J-01 wiring touches config (`UniverseCfg` + `config.yaml`), the engine's sector-writing module
(`scoring.score_stocks`), the methodology content producer (`app.engine.methodology`), and the
`/methodology` frontend page — four modules whose combined interaction (alias resolution, staying
descriptive-only/isolated from every score input, and disclosure rendering) has no single existing
test today. Trigger 3 and trigger 4 were checked and do not hold (last verdict CONTINUE;
consecutive-lean counter 0/6).
**Reversible:** yes
