# Goal Session market-compass — Assumption Ledger

Append-only. Each entry records a scoring decision that required interpreting an
ambiguous goal, so the owner can veto it early.

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** J-01's acceptance bundles four things (single stored source, >=95% coverage,
honest "Unassigned" for unknowns, methodology disclosure). goal.md does not say how to score a
journey where the honesty rails hold but the coverage target is missed by a wide margin.
**We chose:** Scored J-01 `partial` rather than `failing`, on the basis that some acceptance
steps genuinely passed with evidence (DELL/GRMN labels identical across leaderboard, stock detail
and API; unknown serves null, never a fabricated sector) while coverage (78.4% Unassigned vs the
<=5% target) and the methodology disclosure are entirely absent. `partial` here is a factual
record, not credit toward the deliverable — it does not support GOAL_ACHIEVED and the remaining
work is spelled out in the recommendation.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-0 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** goal.md's loop mechanics say "lean by default; full when an iteration first lands
user-visible UI changes", but do not say whether J-01 (mostly backend sector wiring plus one new
Methodology paragraph and changed sector labels on /stocks) counts as a user-visible UI change.
**We chose:** Treated it as user-visible and recommended `full` depth for iteration 1, because
the owner will see different sector labels on /stocks and new disclosure text on /methodology,
and because J-01's "scores must be byte-identical" and "never fabricate a sector" claims benefit
from the audit lane on this session's first product change.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-decomposer

**Ambiguity:** The agent instructions describe two related but not identical trigger sets for
depth=full: the "four escape conditions" that govern when a full spec is justified relative to
the evaluator's binding recommendation (prior ESCALATE/REGRESSION, prior coherence-audit FAIL,
hardening cadence due, or a brand-new full-stack journey) versus the four NUMBERED triggers
required in the `Full trigger:` metadata line (1 Structural/cross-cutting, 2 Data-model
migration, 3 Prior ESCALATE, 4 Hardening cadence). Neither text says how "brand-new full-stack
journey" (the condition that genuinely holds here — this is the session's first code-changing
iteration, matching goal.md's own "full when an iteration first lands user-visible UI changes"
rule) maps onto one of the four numbered triggers for the metadata line and the engine's
arbiter re-validation.
**We chose:** Cited numbered Trigger 1 (Structural/cross-cutting) in the metadata line, grounded
in an objective, mechanically-checkable fact rather than the "first UI" framing: this iteration's
J-01 wiring touches config (`UniverseCfg` + `config.yaml`), the engine's sector-writing module
(`scoring.score_stocks`), the methodology content producer (`app.engine.methodology`), and the
`/methodology` frontend page — four modules whose combined interaction (alias resolution, staying
descriptive-only/isolated from every score input, and disclosure rendering) has no single existing
test today. Trigger 3 and trigger 4 were checked and do not hold (last verdict CONTINUE;
consecutive-lean counter 0/6).
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** The browser-QA lane returned FAIL for J-01 (its precondition step died and it ran
against a stale backend), while the auditor — after fixing the shipped-hidden disclosure — verified
the journey's substance live (fresh run 3081 at as-of 2026-08-12: 0/539 Unassigned via API and a
full 539-row DOM sweep; DELL/GRMN consistent across all three surfaces). goal.md does not say how to
score a journey whose asserted behavior is confirmed live but whose browser-lane capture never
reached the acceptance state.
**We chose:** Scored J-01 `partial` (unchanged label, materially advanced) with
`evidence_makeup: true` and the gap recorded as `capture-defect`, per methodology A.7 — NOT `passing`
(the no-screenshot rail is absolute and no screenshot of the /stocks coverage state exists from any
iteration, nor does the acceptance-required `[NEW]` walkthrough), and NOT `failing` (the behavior is
demonstrably met — I re-measured `GET /api/stocks` myself at 0/539 null). The consequence is that the
make-up capture rides the next iteration as a passenger task, never as its goal.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-1 — goal-evaluator

**Ambiguity:** The browser-QA run permanently destroyed 1,174 bars, 18 snapshots and 30,439 forward
returns for 2026-08-13/14, recoverable only via a live network fetch that AG-9 forbids without an
amendment. No anti-goal names data destruction, and the decision tree's REGRESSION rule fires only
on a passing→failing journey or a critical anti-goal violation.
**We chose:** Did not treat the loss as a REGRESSION or an anti-goal violation — the destroyed bars
were user-added (outside the committed seed, which is intact through 2026-08-12), the product
behaved correctly and refused to fabricate replacements, and no journey depended on those dates.
Recorded it instead as a prominent owner-facing flag in eval.md plus a binding goal.md-amendment
request for J-01 step 1.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-2 — goal-decomposer

**Ambiguity:** The Data Contract's baseline row treats the "Next-session manifest" as one document
with ONE producer (`build_manifest_payload`) covering both the content this iteration targets
(session delta, narrative, candidate selection + why-not) and the freeze/integrity fields goal.md
assigns to J-05/J-06 (mode, version, hashes, provenance, frozen cohort storage,
`prospective_eligible`, `available_at_utc`, export). goal.md's own suggested build order sequences
J-02+J-03+J-04 ("engine cluster... one manifest producer") strictly before J-05+J-06 ("freeze/integrity
pair"), but does not say which manifest fields the engine-cluster iteration must actually persist and
serve versus which stay unbuilt until the freeze iteration — and J-03's own acceptance step 3 names
`content_hash` explicitly ("via the manifest `content_hash`") while the Improvement-direction section
defines `content_hash` as covering exactly "the content block" (session delta + narrative +
candidates/trace), which is exactly the field set this iteration owns.
**We chose:** This iteration builds `build_manifest_payload`'s content-computation logic (session
delta, narrative, `evaluate_selection`'s candidates/why-not/disposition tally) plus `content_hash`
over that block, persisted in a new, minimally-shaped `next_session_manifests` table and served via
`GET /api/compass` (compute-once, serve-from-storage — no per-request recompute). Freeze/versioning/
mode, `manifest_hash`, engine-identity/rule-hash provenance, the frozen `comparison_cohort` /
`near_threshold_shadow` storage and their audit-view rendering, `prospective_eligible`,
`available_at_utc`, and export stay explicitly OUT OF SCOPE, deferred to J-05/J-06, which will extend
the same table with additive columns only.
**Reversible:** yes

## iter-2 — goal-decomposer

**Ambiguity:** The blueprint's Information Architecture already names `/` as the canonical home for
J-02/J-03/J-04's new cards, but `/` is still the unmodified legacy Dashboard (confirmed live:
`sidebar.tsx`'s NAV still labels it "Dashboard", `page.tsx` is the old dashboard component) — goal.md's
full Today-page ordering/chrome (state band above these cards, readiness/preflight separated into
chrome) is J-07's acceptance target and the old dashboard body's relocation to `/market` is J-08's,
both explicitly out of this iteration's targeted journeys per the evaluator's own recommendation.
**We chose:** Add the three new cards (Summary, What-changed, Next-session focus) to the existing `/`
page, above the current unmodified dashboard body, reading only the new `GET /api/compass` endpoint;
leave final section ordering, chrome/readiness separation, and the old body's removal to J-07 and
J-08's own iterations rather than attempting the full page recomposition now.
**Reversible:** yes
