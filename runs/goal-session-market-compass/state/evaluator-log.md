## Iteration 0 — goal-market-compass-iter-0

**Date:** 2026-08-19T22:30:56Z
**Verdict:** CONTINUE
**Depth dispatched:** lean
**Journey deltas:**
- Newly passing: none
- Newly failing: J-02, J-03, J-04, J-05, J-06, J-07, J-08 (first measurement — baseline, not a break)
- Newly partial: J-01 (first measurement)
- Regressed: none
- Anti-goal violations: none

**Reasoning:** This was a baseline check with no code changes, so nothing could break and nothing
could be fixed. The browser run measured all eight journeys against the running app and found the
Today compass simply does not exist yet: the `/api/compass` address returns "not found", the
`/market` page shows a 404, and the home page is still the old Dashboard. I checked the code
myself and confirmed the same thing, so I am not relying on the reports alone. J-01 "Sector
labels are honest and nearly complete" is the one journey that is partly there — the labels that
do exist are consistent everywhere and unknown names honestly say "Unassigned" — but 78 stocks in
every 100 are still unlabelled, against a target of 5. The only files changed since the last
release are documents, so no anti-goal could have been broken.

**Next-step recommendation:** Build J-01 "Sector labels are honest and nearly complete" next:
fill the missing sector labels from the pool spreadsheet, explain the two-source basis on the
Methodology page, keep unknown names as "Unassigned", and prove the stock scores did not move.
Run that iteration at full depth, because it is the first change the owner will see on screen.
